<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>With immediate effect, Singaporeans are advised to defer all non-essential travel abroad. This advisory will apply for 30 days, and will be reviewed thereafter. This is to reduce the risk of Singaporeans contracting COVID-19 while overseas during this global pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore has also increased border restrictions to more countries, including all ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, with a 14-day Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) for arrivals from 16 Mar 11.59 pm, with exemption of those travelling into Singapore from Malaysia via sea or land. Click to access MOH&rsquo;s press release for more information.</p>
<p>You are advised to review your travel plans during the March school holidays, and check the MOH website for the latest measures as well as list of countries that are subject to SHN requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should there be changes to your child&rsquo;s travel plans, please email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sengkanggreen_ps@moe.edu.sg" target="">sengkanggreen_ps@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;or call us at&nbsp;6386 4255 by 17 Mar, Tues.</p>
<p>Thank you and stay safe.</p>

<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope that our students had spent the vacation well and are ready for school. The school year will begin on 2 January 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P2 to P6 students are reminded to be punctual and be at the Parade Square by 7.25am for morning assembly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new P1 students will gather in the canteen by 7.25am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that it rains, teachers will direct the students to the 2020 classrooms for morning assembly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to the 1st day of school and meeting our students again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our Performance Synopsis:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>“SG60: A Celebration of Our Home”</strong>
</p>
<p>In celebration of SG60, Sengkang Green Primary School’s Performing Arts
CCAs are coming together in a heartfelt tribute to the beautiful island
we call “Home”. Weaved together by a poetic and nostalgic narration, each
segment highlights the unique talents of our young performers. The showcase
builds up to a joyful finale - a vibrant combined dance that captures the
spirit of unity and SG pride, sure to leave smiles all around.</p>
<p><strong>b) Artwork Presentation for SG60 with Fernvale Community Centre</strong>
</p>
<p>The school Art Club will be contributing an art piece entitled “<strong><u>The Heart of Fernvale</u></strong>”
to Fernvale CC in celebration of SG60.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This artwork is our SG60 gift to the Fernvale community. Our artwork illustrates
the deep connection between SKGians and the Fernvale residents, forged
through our performances and cyber wellness engagement at community events.
This piece also celebrates our shared spaces, where people of all ages
gather to connect through play and conversation, often over a meal.&nbsp;
Through our artwork, we capture the warmth and spirit of our neighbourhood.
We believe that when people look out for one another, a simple space becomes
a home. We hope that the artwork will remind us to be kind to one another
and contribute to building a stronger Singapore together.</p>

<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>Schools will re-open for Term 2 on 23 Mar (Monday) as planned.</p>
<p>MOH has announced that 14-day Stay Home Notice (SHN) will be issued to returning Singapore Residents and visitors from all countries. To further protect our schools, MOE will implement additional precautionary measures by issuing a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) to students and staff who have been out of Singapore on or after 14 Mar. Day zero of the 14 days of the LOA will commence from the date of their return to Singapore, and affected students should keep away from schools with immediate effect, i.e. from tomorrow (20 March) until the end of the 14 days. All affected students will be supported via home-based learning. You may approach your child&rsquo;s school for clarifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We assure parents that all schools have been thoroughly cleaned and enhanced hygiene measures are in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOE will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

<p>Dear Students, Parents and Partners,</p>
<p>Happy New Year and welcome to a new school year at Sengkang Green Primary
School! As we begin 2025, I am excited about the great opportunities and growth awaiting everyone in our school community.</p>
<br><strong><u>Reflecting on 2024</u></strong>
<p>Last year, our school focused on “Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Promoting
Holistic Health,” encouraging SKGians to care for their physical, mental,
emotional, social health, and Cyber Wellness. The emphasis from 2024 will
continue to guide us.</p>

<br><strong><u>Our Theme for 2025: "Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Learning with Technology"</u></strong><br>
<p>This year, we move forward with the theme, “Becoming a Future-ready Learner
– Learning with Technology”. Technology is impacting education, work, and
daily life at an unprecedented pace, so it’s important for our SKGians
to build the skills and mindset and become happy learners who uses it confidently
and responsibly.</p>
<p>At Sengkang Green, we are committed to preparing SKGians to excel in a
digitally interconnected world. They will learn essential digital skills.
These skills will help SKGians use technology effectively, safely, and
responsibly. It also involves nurturing problem-solving and critical thinking
skills through the use of digital tools. We want to help our SKGians become
adaptable so they can handle change and face challenges with creativity
and resilience.</p>
<p>Our focus on communication, collaboration, and critical thinking, combined
with adaptive and inventive thinking (CAIT), will empower our SKGians to
harness technology in meaningful ways. Aligned with our school’s mission,
we nurture SKGians’ ability to connect and collaborate with peers beyond
classroom. These competencies will not only enhance their learning experiences
but also prepare them to “be ready to serve” now and in the future.

<p>By leveraging technology, SKGians can explore new perspectives, broaden
their horizons, and participate in global learning opportunities. In 2024,
some SKGians met peers from Ban Mai School, our partner school in Hanoi,
Vietnam via online conferencing, with the guidance of their teachers. Technology
can help us to make connections beyond the classroom.
</p>
<p>The Student Learning Space (SLS), an MOE provision, offers a safe platform
for SKGians to explore learning with technology independently and collaboratively
with their teachers and peers. SLS also incorporates Artificial Intelligence
features. An example is Language Feedback Assistant for English (LangFA-EL),
which can be used to support school-based curriculum, and enhance teaching
and learning practices as follows:</p>
<br>1. LangFA-EL provides feedback akin to peer-editing to help SKGians identify
possible areas for improvement in grammatical accuracy and clarity of meaning.
It can be useful in practices such as process writing.
<br>
<br>2. Teachers can decide when LangFA-EL is activated during the writing
process (planning, drafting or revision stage) for SKGians to correct their
basic language errors. This gives SKGians the chance to not be fearful
to make mistakes and then review their language errors.
<br>
<br>3. LangFA-EL is meant to complement and ride on existing teaching and
learning practices and makes the use of writing assignments on SLS more
meaningful.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Technology is not everything</u></strong>
<br>
<br>In schools, integrating technology into learning offers exciting opportunities
to enhance education, but it is essential to approach it thoughtfully.
Technology should not overshadow traditional teaching methods but instead
serve as part of a diverse set of strategies that support effective learning.
By combining technological tools with other proven approaches, we can create
a well-rounded educational experience that fosters quality outcomes for
all students.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Importance of Cyber Wellness</u></strong>
<br>
<br>As we embrace technology in learning, it is equally important to guide
SKGians to develop strong values and habits. This year, we will continue
to emphasize on Cyber Wellness so that SKGians are:
<br>
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; responsible digital citizens who respect others and use
technology ethically.
<br>
<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; able to manage screen time effectively to ensure a
healthy balance between online and offline activities.
<br>
<br>SKGians will learn a comprehensive range of Cyber Wellness topics through
a spiral approach, with age-appropriate content, as shown in the table
below. Through these efforts over the six primary school years, SKGians
will develop a deep understanding of how to use technology as a tool for
growth while maintaining overall well-being.
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness area of focus for 2025</strong>

<br><strong><u>Partnership with Parents</u></strong>
<br>
<br>Parents’ role in guiding and supporting your children’s use of technology
is invaluable in terms of cultivating good values and forming good habits.
By creating a positive and constructive learning environment at home which
incorporates technology on top of a broad range of other social activities,
you help to develop your children holistically. Together, we can nurture
a generation of happy and healthy learners who are able to navigate learning
in a diverse range of education settings.
<br>
<br>As we begin this journey, I invite students, parents, teachers, and stakeholders
to work together to make this year’s theme a success. Let’s embrace technology’s
opportunities while staying mindful of its challenges. Together, we can
build a supportive learning environment where every student thrives.
<br>
<br>Thank you for being an important part of our school community. I look
forward to an amazing year of learning and growth!
<br>
<br>Sincerely yours,
<br>

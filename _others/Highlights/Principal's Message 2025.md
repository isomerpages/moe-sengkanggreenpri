<p><strong>Principal’s Message 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Dear Parents, SKGians, valued partners and visitors to our school website,</strong>
</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Sengkang Green Primary School. At Sengkang Green, our
journey has always been centred on developing every child into a future-ready
learner—one who has a good character anchored on sound values, is healthy
in mind and body, confident in learning, and equipped to thrive in a fast-changing
world.</p>
<p>In 2024, our school theme, <strong><em>Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Promoting Holistic Health</em></strong>,
guided our efforts to nurture students’ physical, social and emotional
well-being, and cyberwellness habits, empowering the learners to take charge
of their total health.</p>
<p>Building on the previous year’s foundation, our 2025 theme, <strong><em>Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Learning with Technology</em></strong>,
focused on strengthening teaching and learning through the purposeful use
of technology. Our teachers thoughtfully harnessed technology to deepen
learning, while students used digital tools to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>annotate and discuss texts collaboratively,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>organise their thinking using concept-mapping and reflection platforms,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive timely feedback through adaptive learning systems and feedback
assistants on the Student Learning Space (SLS), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in blended lessons where classroom discussions were extended through
online reading tasks, quizzes and reflections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These deliberate efforts laid a strong foundation for deeper engagement,
greater learner ownership and meaningful learning—setting the stage for
our 2026 focus on <em>Enhancing Reading Literacy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Our School Theme for 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Enhancing Reading Literacy</strong>
</p>
<p>Reading is the heartbeat of learning. It forms the foundation for understanding
across all subjects. When students read with purpose and curiosity, they
learn to think critically, connect ideas and make sense of the world around
them.</p>
<p>By enhancing reading literacy, we empower our students to become better
learners—more reflective, more independent, and more future-ready to explore,
question and create across different domains of knowledge. Through stories
and diverse perspectives, reading also nurtures empathy and helps students
appreciate the values that shape how they live, learn and grow, both as
individuals and as members of a community.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Literacy: Beyond Books</strong>
</p>
<p>At Sengkang Green, reading literacy goes beyond storybooks. In today’s
world, students encounter information in many forms—digital texts, data,
visuals, media articles and multimodal resources. Strong reading literacy
equips them to navigate information confidently, interpret content critically
and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Language subjects lay the foundation by building vocabulary, comprehension
and expression. These skills are then extended across the curriculum:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In <strong>Science</strong>, students read explanations, analyse data and
interpret reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Mathematics</strong>, they make sense of word problems, shapes
and graphs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Physical Education</strong>, they read health information and
nutrition labels to make informed choices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading is therefore not confined to the language classroom. Teachers
and students share a common understanding that reading supports learning
in every subject, enabling students to think critically, make meaning and
approach learning with confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Nurturing Learning Dispositions Through Reading</strong>
</p>
<p>Enhancing reading literacy also strengthens important learning dispositions
such as curiosity, grit, engagement and appreciation. When students engage
deeply with texts, they learn to ask thoughtful questions, persevere with
challenging texts, reflect on ideas and appreciate perspectives different
from their own. These dispositions are essential for character development
and lifelong learning.</p>
<p><strong>Our Ongoing Efforts</strong>
</p>
<p>Our emphasis on reading literacy began well before 2026. Through our school-wide
reading goal, SKGians are empowered to read at least 15 minutes daily to
build fluency and develop a love for reading. Teachers also engage students
in reading activities during morning assemblies—because at Sengkang Green,
every day is a reading day.</p>
<p>Our school library, <strong><em>Our Learning Hub</em></strong>, continues
to be a vibrant learning space. Beyond borrowing books, students use the
space to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>explore information across subjects,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in inquiry and collaborative work, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn to navigate and interpret multimodal texts from different sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <strong><em>READ@SKG initiative</em></strong> brings stories to life
during Monday (English Language) and Thursday (Mother Tongue Language)
assemblies. In addition to reading English texts, students read Mother
Tongue books, helping them learn about their cultures while building confidence
to engage with the world around them.</p>
<p>Through our <strong><em>Morning Refresh programmes</em></strong>, students
begin each day meaningfully. Listening to stories, reading news articles
and participating in discussions broaden their perspectives and reinforce
purposeful reading habits. Through shared reading and discussion, students
make personal connections with texts and deepen their appreciation of stories.</p>
<p><strong>An Important Partnership</strong>
</p>
<p>Enhancing reading literacy is a collective effort. <strong><em>Parents play a vital role</em></strong> in
nurturing a love for reading at home—through shared reading, conversations
about books, reading newspapers and bedtime stories. As a purposeful offline
activity, reading provides opportunities for families to connect and learn
together. These shared experiences help children see reading as enjoyable,
relevant and enriching.</p>
<p>Together, as a school and community, we can build a strong reading culture
that inspires every SKGian to read with curiosity, confidence and purpose.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued partnership and trust. I look forward to
another meaningful year of learning and growth as we journey together in
shaping future-ready learners.</p>

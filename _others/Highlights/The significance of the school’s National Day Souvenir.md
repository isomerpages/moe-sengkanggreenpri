<p><strong>Happy National Day 2024!</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>"Together, As One United People"</strong> is the theme for this
year’s National Day Celebrations, highlighting our collective strength
and the importance of unity. This theme underscores our nation's success
and resilience, reflecting the spirit of inclusivity, community, and trust
that has enabled us to thrive over the past 59 years.</p>
<p>Our school theme “Becoming a Future-Ready Learner: Promoting Holistic
Health” echoes this commitment by nurturing healthy and happy individuals
with strength of character, ready to serve and face the future. Promoting
holistic health from an early age builds a foundation of health literacy
and awareness, ensuring our children grow into well-rounded, healthy adults.</p>
<p>Engaging in the visual arts is a key aspect of this approach. Art activities
promote holistic health by fostering creativity, reducing stress, and nurturing
a balanced, joyful mind and spirit. This empowers students to become confident,
engaged learners equipped with essential skills for the 21st century. We
are pleased to present each SKGian with a specially designed National Day
souvenir, a set of coloured pencils housed in a specially designed container
decorated with the National Day theme and the school theme. We hope to
inspire all SKGians to participate in art activities to nurture their total
well-being.</p>

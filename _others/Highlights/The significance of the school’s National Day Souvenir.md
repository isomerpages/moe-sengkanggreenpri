<p><strong>Happy National Day 2024!</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>"Together, As One United People"</strong> is the theme for this
year’s National Day Celebrations, highlighting our collective strength
and the importance of unity. This theme underscores our nation's success
and resilience, reflecting the spirit of inclusivity, community, and trust
that has enabled us to thrive over the past 59 years.</p>
<p>Our school theme “Becoming a Future-Ready Learner: Promoting Holistic
Health” echoes this commitment by nurturing healthy and happy individuals
with strength of character, ready to serve and face the future. Promoting
holistic health from an early age builds a foundation of health literacy
and awareness, ensuring our children grow into well-rounded, healthy adults.</p>
<p>Engaging in the visual arts is a key aspect of this approach. Art activities
promote holistic health by fostering creativity, reducing stress, and nurturing
a balanced, joyful mind and spirit. This empowers students to become confident,
engaged learners equipped with essential skills for the 21st century. We
are pleased to present each SKGian with a specially designed National Day
souvenir, a set of coloured pencils housed in a specially designed container
decorated with the National Day theme and the school theme. We hope to
inspire all SKGians to participate in art activities to nurture their total
well-being.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrating Singapore’s 59<sup>th</sup> Birthday with SKGians</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school’s Learning for Life Programme – ICAR<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>E
through the Arts, aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who contribute
meaningfully to the community, through the learning and display of school
values, knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>These experiences are designed to promote student agency and initiative.
As part of the art creation process, students reflect on their experiences,
the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute
meaningfully to their community.</p>
<p><strong>Our students will take part in the two activities as part of Singapore’s 59<sup>th</sup> Birthday Celebrations:</strong>

<p><strong>Our Performance Sypnosis:</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Our dance performance, "Alice in Funkyland," garnered a Distinction Award in this year’s Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. In this fun and imaginative dance, Alice embarks on an adventure into the unknown in Funkyland, where every character comes to life with energetic and funky dance moves. From the quirky Alices to the playful Rabbits, our dancers display curiosity and confidence as they explore Funkyland.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>As our students dance together, they demonstrate the power of collaboration despite their diverse individualities. This perfectly aligns with the theme for this year’s National Day celebrations: “Together, As One United People.” Through "Alice in Funkyland," we celebrate how working together and appreciating each other’s uniqueness can make us stronger and more united.”</em>

<p>
<br>This Art Outreach collaboration with the National Museum extends our SKGians
learning experiences beyond the school, and provides a valued opportunity
for them to lead others and strengthen their communication skills as they
guide the younger children and their family in the art-making process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the preparation, our students from Art Club</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went on a guided tour
to the National Museum of Singapore to gain an understanding of the lifestyle
of people living in the period from the 1920s to the 1990s</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participated in hands-on
sessions to practise making the crafts</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rehearsed with peers
on how to provide clear instructions and guide young children&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that the experience will help them learn to understand and
appreciate Singapore’s history and heritage, developing a stronger sense
of national identity. These authentic experiences are invaluable in nurturing
our student agency and helping them become effective communicators and
well-rounded individuals.</p>

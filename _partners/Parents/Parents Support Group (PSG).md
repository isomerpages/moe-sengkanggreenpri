To regain back the vibrancy of enriching of our children’s learnings, the school and PSG are constantly and actively exploring ways to engage, connect and reach out to our PSG community.</p><p>Over the years, I have learnt and participated with my children in many SKGPS-PSG collaborated activities. Through my active participation and involvement in the school activities have sent a strong signal to them that I am giving time to be part of their learning journeys and showing interest in their school life. I am now more aware of what they are experiencing in school, have more common school-life topics to talk about, and foster greater parent-child relationship and bonding. This gives me a better sense of assurance that my children are truly enjoying school life.</p><p>To sum it up, being a PSG member, you will get to build a close rapport with our school leaders and teachers, network with fellow parents, share/gain parenting tips and create wonderful memories with your child through regular participation in school and PSG activities. We invite you to come and participate in our activities throughout the school terms whenever your schedule permits.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you and /or your spouse to join our Parent Support Group. Let this mark the beginning of the strong partnership between you and SKGPS.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to share a quote with you that touches me, by Jesse Jackson “Your children need your presence more than your presents.” So come join us and let’s make a difference together in your child’s learning!</p><p>Thank you.<br>Sherlyn Ong<br>Chairperson, SKGPS Parent Support Group</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 25%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/skgp psg logo revised 2022 mid.png"></div><p><br><br><br><br></p><p><strong><u>Meaning of PSG Logo</u></strong></p><p>The SKGPS PSG logo features many outstretched hands, signifying volunteering and working together to make a difference.

<p>PSG Chairperson Message for 2024</p>
<p>Hi Parents,</p>
<p>Welcome to Sengkang Green Primary School Parent Support Group (PSG).</p>
<p>PSG is welcoming new leadership and members in 2024.</p>
<p>It is my great pleasure to take on this journey as the next Chairperson
of PSG.</p>
<p>I believe in working closely with school and teachers for a more holistic
learning experience for our children. Joining PSG is one of the way to
achieve it.</p>
<p>In PSG, I get to know other like minded parents who have the same passion.</p>
<p>We fulfilled our passion through facilitating school activities at our
available time to help children enhanced their learning experience in school.</p>
<p>Parents get to connect through school activities and interest groups like
exercising, dancing, singing and crafting. We shared valuable parenting
tips and school information.</p>
<p>My involvement through school activities is my way of showing support
for my child's learning journey. In turn I hope it will motivate her to
excel in school.</p>
<p>My child and i have more common topics to discuss at home as well in which
I can relate better when she shared about her experiences in school.</p>
<p>Together with my two Vice Chairpersons, Mdm Daisy Tan, and Mdm Chin Kai
Li, we hope to bring new experiences and adventures to PSG in the coming
years.</p>
<p>All the above will not be possible without a capable and competent team
- the PSG EXCOs. I'm thankful for their commitments and having them as
my wonderful working partners.</p>
<p>On top of that, having a strong and supportive team of PSG members, the
parents, is one that I'm most grateful for. You are our most valuable resource.</p>
<p>No school activities can be successful without your physical support and
contributions.</p>
<p>United by our passion to volunteer in school, we hope to bring PSG to
a greater height.</p>
<p>Do come join us if you hold the same passion and we look forward to partner
you in this journey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile i wish all be safe, well and happy!</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<p>Catherine Lim
<br>Chairperson, SKGPS Parent Support Group</p>

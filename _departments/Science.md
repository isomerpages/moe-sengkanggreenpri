<p><strong><u>Department Aims and Objectives</u></strong></p>
<p>The Science department aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>stimulate child&rsquo;s curiosity and passion for science through&nbsp;<strong><u>meaningful, authentic experiences</u></strong></li>
<li>nurture&nbsp;<strong><u>reflective thinkers</u></strong>&nbsp;who ask scientific questions and appreciate how science affects their lives, the society and the environment</li>
<li>develop&nbsp;<strong><u>scientific literacy</u></strong>&nbsp;in learners to face challenges of the future&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The three integral domains in the diagram are essential in the practice of science in Sengkang Green Primary School. These domains; (a) Authentic Experiences, (b) Reflection and (c) Scientific Literacy, are interdependently connected to enable our pupils to view science as meaningful and useful.</p>

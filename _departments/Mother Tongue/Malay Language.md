<p>In alignment to the school&rsquo;s Teaching and Learning Framework, the department engages the students in learning through the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a repertoire of school-wide student-centric pedagogies to make student learning visible through strategies such as Cooperative Learning, Collaborative Learning and Differentiated Instruction;</li>
<li>Leverage on students&rsquo; familiarity and regular use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Mother Tongue Language (MTL) learning;</li>

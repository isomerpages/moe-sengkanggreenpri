<p><u><strong>Our Strategies</strong></u></p>
<img style="width: 75%;" src="/images/cl1.jpeg">
<p>In alignment to the school&rsquo;s Teaching and Learning Framework, the department engages the students in learning through the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate the 3 primary strategies, namely Active Learning, Problem-based and Project-based learning in the MTL curriculum development;</li>
<li>Use a repertoire of school-wide student-centric pedagogies to make student learning visible through strategies such as Cooperative Learning, Collaborative Learning and Differentiated Instruction;</li>
<li>Leverage on students&rsquo; familiarity and regular use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Mother Tongue Language (MTL) learning;</li>
<li>Create platforms and opportunities that encourage students to use their MTL to communicate proficiently in everyday life and to develop a deeper appreciation of their culture; and</li>
<li>Provide timely feedback to parents on students&rsquo; learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Key Programmes<br /><br /></u></strong><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Bi-Cultural Bridge Programme<br /><br /></strong>The Bi-Cultural Bridge (BcB) programme aims to develop bicultural talents who are passionate about learning the Chinese culture and language. This programme stretches the potential of a student who is proficient in both languages and allows them to appreciate the Chinese culture in greater depth. It also provides enriched learning experiences and higher learning standards for all the high-ability learners.</p>
<p>The 2-year programme is designed to develop a core group of students from Primary 4 to Primary 5 who are effectively bilingual and bicultural. Lessons and activities are geared towards equipping students with a comprehensive understanding of Chinese culture, history, literature and the arts.</p>

<p><strong>2. SKG Celebrate cum Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</strong></p>
<p>The SKG Celebrate cum MTL Fortnight aims to create an immersive environment for our students in their learning of the Mother Tongue language and culture. During the programme, a wide range of cultural and language activities related to the Mother Tongue languages&nbsp;are&nbsp;organised for students. Activities such as&nbsp;kite making, fabric hand puppet making and dramatization&nbsp;provide opportunities for students to experience their respective cultures and also encourage them to use their Mother Tongue languages for interactions.</p>
<p>A variety of fun-filled language games and cultural activities are organised during our SKG Celebrate. We believe our young learners learn through play&nbsp;（娱教乐学）&nbsp;and imbibe&nbsp;values of respect and discipline when participating in the MTL Fortnight activities.</p>

<p><strong><u>Physical Education in Lower Primary (P1- P3)</u></strong></p>
<p>The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students&rsquo; performance as they practice and transfer their skills across the seven learning areas to become competent movers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Physical Education in Upper Primary (P4-P6)</u></strong></p>
<p>Once the foundation of fundamental skills mastery is laid at the lower primary level (P1- P3), the upper primary level (P4- P6) extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.</p>
<p>Due to the spiral nature of the PE curriculum, the learning of fundamental skills are revisited from time to time to sharpen and deepen the students&rsquo; mastery.</p>

<p><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Recess Play</em></p>
<p>To encourage students to be active, PE equipment such as skipping ropes, colourful giant parachute, soccer balls, frisbees etc are provided in the school&rsquo;s basketball court and field for the students to play during recess. This allows students to make good use of their free time to exercise and enjoy the outdoors.</p>
<p><em>Workout Thursday</em></p>
<p>On Thursdays, SKGians look forward to start off the day with an exercise routine. Primary 4 and 6 students will be engaged in morning jogs in the school field while Primary 1, 2, 3 and 5 students will be involved in the Jump Jam Workout, a fun and exciting kids aerobic programme. Workout Wednesdays seek to motivate SKGians to enjoy exercise, thus promoting healthy and happy individuals in SKG.</p>

<p><em>Fruity Veggie Week</em></p>
<p>Fruity Veggie Week is carried out every year to encourage our students to eat healthily. During the Fruity Veggie Week, all staff and students are expected to eat 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables every day. Various activities to reinforce the importance of eating healthily are conducted. This includes assembly talk and interesting recess games.</p>

<p><em>Games Carnival</em></p>
<p>Games Carnival is a key SKGPS sporting event that is held on Children&rsquo;s Day. The aim of the event is to provide opportunity for students to apply psychomotor skills that they had learnt during PE lessons, in a fun, cooperative and competitive game environment. These games not only promote mass participation but also put to test both individual and team camaraderie and help build class affiliation, school spirit and bonding among the students and teachers.</p>

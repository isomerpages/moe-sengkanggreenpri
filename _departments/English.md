<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key Programmes</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Read@SKGPS Programme</strong></p>
<p>We believe that reading helps our students build their language skills, thus the reading habit and the love for reading should be cultivated since young. To this end, we have collaborated with the National Library Board (NLB) on various reading programmes and activities to get our students engaged and motivated to read. Reading is a huge part of the English Language curriculum and teachers conduct&nbsp;regular reading periods during which both teachers and students simply read for a set period of time, hold book talks, do book presentations or engage in reading activities.</p>

<p><strong>Supplementary Reading Programme&nbsp;<br /></strong>To promote a positive attitude towards reading, we weave reading into the daily life of the students. An inviting reading corner is a staple feature in the classroom where students can look forward to reading a wide variety of books. In addition, we provide access to quality fiction and non-fiction texts for all our students through the Supplementary Reading Programme. Our students subscribe to graded readers and student-friendly newspapers which are used by teachers to teach language skills in class.</p>
<p><strong>P2 Reader&rsquo;s Theatre Programme<br /></strong>All our P2 students engage in weekly Reader&rsquo;s Theatre lessons during curriculum time to develop communication and collaborative skills. The programme aims to develop our students into confident and communicators as Reader&rsquo;s Theatre integrates reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. Both reluctant and fluent readers learn to enjoy rhythm, sound and language in a creative environment. By getting the students involved in an authentic cooperative activity to develop their confidence in reading aloud and fluency, we hope to excite our students in language learning. They especially enjoy having the opportunity to showcase their skills and talents in a class performance with their parents as their enthusiastic audience.</p>

<p><strong>Literature Programme</strong><br />Our students are introduced to literature study from Primary Three to Primary Five. Through the study of literature, our students learn about the purpose of reading &ndash; understanding and appreciating a writer's use of language to hook an audience of readers. Literature also shows our students how writing entails making choices to create an impact on the reader. Through literature, the study of the forms and structures of language &ndash; vocabulary, grammar and syntax &ndash; is transformed into something living and relevant to the learner&rsquo;s need to communicate effectively in a complex world.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Learning Support Learning Support Programme (LSP)<br /></strong>The LSP for English, a specialised early intervention programme, provides additional support for students with weak literacy skills. Students attend lessons for one period a day in small groups, and are taught by specially trained teachers using strategies that will improve their reading ability. More attention is given to equipping our students with basic literacy skills so they can access learning in the regular classroom.</p>
<p><strong>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)<br /></strong>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme is a two-year intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 students. The students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</strong><br />The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for P3 and P4 students who still face consistent difficulty in reading in the English Language despite having completed the Learning Support Programme in P1 and P2. The programme exposes students to a range of coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their learning in the regular classroom.</p>

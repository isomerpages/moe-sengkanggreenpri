<p><strong>Head of Department:</strong>&nbsp;Mrs Gina Cho&nbsp;<br /><strong>Level Head:</strong> Mdm Wong Yoke Lye</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Department Aims and Objectives:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Every SKGian is a&nbsp;<strong>Confident&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Effective Problem Solver</strong></p>
<p>We aim to equip all students with the mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics</p>
<p>At the end of Primary 6, students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire the relevant mathematical skills and concepts to apply in real life situations.</li>
<li>Develop creative and critical problem solving skills.</li>
<li>Cultivate positive attitude towards mathematics.</li>
<li>Make effective use of various mathematical tools (including ICT tools) in the learning and application of mathematics.</li>
<li>Become independent and self-directed learners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Programmes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. L.E.A.P. Programme (Learning Effective Approach to Problem-solving)</strong></p>
<p>Mathematical problem-solving is a central focus of the mathematics curriculum. It involves the application of mathematical concepts and skills to solve a variety of problems, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems. To develop students to be effective problem solvers, students are exposed to heuristics and problem-solving approaches such as the Polya&rsquo;s four step problem-solving in class.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learning Experiences</strong></p>
<p>Learning experiences are designed based on the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach. Students explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills through engaging in authentic learning activities. They use concrete manipulatives and visual representations to construct understandings. From the concrete and pictorial experiences, they are guided to uncover abstract mathematical concepts. In this way, students see the meaning and relevance of mathematics.</p>

<p><strong><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong></strong><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</strong></p>
<p>Learning Support Mathematics (LSM) programme provides support for selected Primary 1 and Primary 2 students who need more reinforcement in their learning of basic numeracy in Mathematics. Students are placed in smaller groups and engaged in customized learning activities based on their learning progress.</p>
<p><strong>4. Mathematics Olympiad Programme</strong></p>
<p>The Mathematics Olympiad programme provides opportunities for selected students in P3, P4 and P5 to extend their learning. Students are exposed to higher-order questions and are equipped with a repertoire of problem-solving strategies and higher-order thinking skills to solve these questions. This will enable students to sharpen their mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Major Events</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Mathematics Carnival<br /></strong>The Mathematics Carnival provides an opportunity for our students to practise mathematics through games to achieve mastery. The carnival also includes a reward system that aims to reinforce positive behaviour and expectations. Four weeks prior to the carnival, our students will be &lsquo;rewarded&rsquo; with carnival tokens when they display school values such as responsibility and active teamwork during math lessons. These tokens will then be used to play the mathematical games at the carnival.</p>
<p>The carnival also allows the students to practise financial literacy through authentic learning. They will need to 'spend' their tokens at the game stalls and be involved in decision making by deciding on what games to play for the amount of tokens that they have.</p>

<p><strong>2. Mathematics Trail</strong></p>
<p>Mathematics Trail in SKGPS provides students with the opportunity to relate mathematical concepts and skills that they have learnt to the real world. Students work in teams to apply mathematical concepts and skills such as the use of mathematical tools and estimation to complete authentic learning tasks within the school compound. Learning of mathematics becomes fun, meaningful and relevant for the students.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. P1 and P2 Mathematics Parent's Workshop</strong></p>
<p>As part of SKGPS&rsquo; school-home partnership efforts, mathematics workshops are conducted for parents of Primary 1 and 2 students. The objectives of the workshops are to enable parents to gain greater understanding of the Primary Mathematics Syllabus and how the school engages students to acquire mathematical concepts and skills through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach. During the workshop, parents get to experience how a mathematical concept is taught using the CPA approach. Parents are also provided with tips on how they can support their children in the learning of mathematics. For the past few years, the workshops were well received by parents. Parents have expressed that the workshops benefitted them in engaging their children in the learning of mathematics at home.</p>

<p><strong>4. iDiscovery Day</strong></p>
<p>Our Primary 3 to Primary 5 students are engaged in challenging and fun activities that promote analytical and social skills. Students work in teams to solve mathematical puzzles which involve addition and multiplication in the fastest way possible. Puzzles offer opportunities to expand social skills and they are a great way to develop and strengthen reasoning and logical thinking skills that are essential to mathematics.</p>
<p>When children work cooperatively to complete a puzzle, they engage in active conversation. They develop a plan to solve the puzzles by taking turns and helping one another.</p>
<p>Through this programme, our students demonstrate great interest in the mathematical tasks given and show their perseverance in solving the puzzles. This is closely-knitted to one of the department objectives &ndash; for our students to develop positive attitudes towards Mathematics.</p>

<p><strong>Student Leadership Programme</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>We Lead, We Serve and We Influence</u></strong></p>
<p>At Sengkang Green Primary, we believe that every child has inherent leadership qualities and hence can be a leader. These qualities can be honed as the child blossoms in his character development. Thus, the school focuses primarily on a values-based student-centric leadership programme. In addition, the school believes that all student leaders are servant leaders who serve not just their class, the school but also the community-at-large. This is aligned to our school &amp; student leadership mission:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&ldquo;To develop confident leaders, with strength of character who are ready to serve&rdquo;.</em></strong></p>
<p>In preparing our students to be future leaders, a four-level approach to student leadership development is adopted.</p>
<p><strong>LEVEL 1: PERSONAL LEADERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>In line with the school&rsquo;s vision, the department has adopted Kouzes and Posner&rsquo;s (2005) Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership as outcomes for the SKGPS Student Leadership Programme. Through the programme, we aim to inculcate all students the following 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership:</p>
<ul>
<li>To follow school rules and model good habits and routines</li>
<li>To inspire the vision of&nbsp;<strong><em>&lsquo;To be the best that I can be&rsquo;</em></strong></li>
<li>To search for opportunities to change and improve the school by providing constructive suggestions and solutions</li>
<li>To foster collaboration that enable others to act</li>
<li>To have the passion to encourage the heart of others</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LEVEL 2: PEER LEADERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>At level 2, selected P2 &ndash; P6 students are appointed as class leaders. Students undergo a basic Class Leaders Training programme with the aim to develop students&rsquo; character and leadership skills. During the training session, the class leaders are provided with a clear understanding of their specific leadership roles and responsibilities as well as ways in which they can be actively involved to assist teachers and peers. They are taught skills to better manage relationship with their peers.</p>
<p><strong>LEVEL 3: SCHOOL-WIDE LEADERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>At level 3, selected P3 &ndash; P6 students are appointed as Student Leaders. They consists of Prefects &amp; CCA Leaders. Student Leaders are the esteemed ambassadors that best portray the desired traits of Sengkang Green Primary Schools students.</p>
<p><strong><u>Prefects<br /></u></strong>The purpose of the Prefectorial Board is to identify and develop students in service leadership &amp; development. Theywill need to adhere closely to the Prefects&rsquo; Code of Conduct and school ICAR<sup>2</sup>E values.&nbsp;They go through several training sessions such as Conflict Management, Interpersonal Communication &amp; Project Management to hone and sharpen their service leadership skills.</p>
<p><strong><u>CCA Leaders<br /></u></strong>CCA leaders are responsible for providing visionary leadership in the CCA in terms of setting and achieving goals, while leading the CCA in the planning and execution of meetings and activities. They are expected to carry out their duties with commitment, dedication, integrity and responsibility in order to bring their CCA to greater heights.</p>
<p>As part of their service to the school and community, our student leaders have the opportunity to serve and be part of several school programs and events. These events are platforms for them to develop and display their service leadership competencies.</p>

<p><strong>National Education (NE) Programme</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of National Education is to develop &amp; inspire our students to take collective ownership of their future as a nation and to co construct the next chapter of Singapore. NE is then anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which will enable our students to realise their part in flourishing of the community and nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Citizenship Dispositions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)<br> ‘ICAR<sup>2</sup>E Through Arts @ Sengkang Green Primary School’</strong></p>
<p>ICAR<sup>2</sup>E Through Arts, is the signature Learning for Life Programme (LLP) at Sengkang Green Primary School that applies Inquiry-Based Learning in the Arts Education to inspire and motivate our students to foster positive values and traits; to have strength of character and ready to serve. Through inquiry, students learn about values of Integrity, Care, Active Teamwork, Respect, Responsibility and Excellence (<strong>ICAR<sup>2</sup>E</strong>) by creating and responding to art.</p>
<p>The LLP designed is rooted to the belief that ‘<strong>All SKGiangs are artists at work in our own special ways.</strong>’ The four domains in the framework are: Inspire, Inquire, Create and Connect. Through the different learning experiences, students inspire and inquire, and vice versa. This leads to creation of various art forms: Performing Arts, Visual Arts and Literary Arts. In this process, students are able to connect purposefully to oneself, meaningfully to others and respectfully towards the environment and their surroundings.</p>

<p>By undergoing this programme, it provides our students opportunities to develop into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confident persons with a mind-set of excellence and integrity</li>
<li>Active team players who can communicate effectively</li>
<li>Engaged learners with a passion for learning and a sense of responsibility</li>
<li>Concerned citizens who are caring and respectful</li>
</ul>

<p>The LLP is structures such that students are equipped with various arts skills. Beyond the classrooms, these skills are transferrable in other settings. The LLP key programmes are platforms designed for students to use their aesthetics skills and talents not only inspire themselves by also to inspire others. Through the inquiry approach, students create art to express themselves. The Young Care Givers’ programme is a platform where students make use of their musical skills to perform for the residents at the hospice as well as engage the elderly in craft making.</p>

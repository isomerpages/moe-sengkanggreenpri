<p><strong>LLP: ICAR2E THROUGH THE ARTS</strong></p>
<p>ICAR<sup>2</sup>E THROUGH THE ARTS programme at Sengkang Green Primary School is a structured whole school approach that harnesses the benefits of arts education to inculcate the school values of Integrity, Care, Active Teamwork, Respect, Responsibility and Excellence (ICAR<sup>2</sup>E) in our students, to develop them into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confident persons with a mind-set of excellence and integrity</li>
<li>Active team players who can communicate effectively</li>
<li>Engaged learners with a passion for learning and a sense of responsibility</li>
<li>Concerned citizens who are caring and respectful</li>
</ul>
<p>Leveraging on the arts, namely performing arts, visual arts and literary arts, as a natural mean for character building, the programme aims to develop SKGians, into citizens who are&nbsp;<strong><u>ready to serve</u></strong>, and&nbsp;<strong><u>ready for the future</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Designed by the teachers of SKG, the 3P pedagogical approach ensures that values are taught explicitly. The programme is infused into the Arts curriculum to allow all students to enjoy enhanced experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: Values education through engagement of students in art and music making</p>
<p><strong>Product</strong>: Expressing their values through their artworks &amp; music</p>
<p><strong>Prop</strong>: Values-rich resources to trigger art and music making</p>

<p>Through the structured LLP programmes, students are equipped with various arts skills. Beyond the classrooms, these skills are transferrable in other settings. The LLP key programmes are platforms designed for students to use their aesthetics skills and talents to contribute to others. The Young Care Givers’ programme is a platform where students make use of their musical skills to perform for the residents at the hospice as well as engage the elderly in craft making.</p>

<p>In ICAR<sup>2</sup>E Through the Arts LLP,&nbsp;partners and stakeholders are presented with a different view of how the arts contribute to a child’s growth and character development. Students are able to witness the impact and the joy they bring to the community. This encourages them to seek opportunities to use their talents in a meaningful way.</p>

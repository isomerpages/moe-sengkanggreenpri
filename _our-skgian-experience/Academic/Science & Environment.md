<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Mission</u></strong></p>
<p>To nurture&nbsp;passionate,&nbsp;caring, and&nbsp;inquisitive learners&nbsp;for the&nbsp;environment and conservation&nbsp;and show&nbsp;appreciation for the beauty&nbsp;and&nbsp;wonders of science&nbsp;and have the&nbsp;skills of a critical and scientifically literate individual&nbsp;to be&nbsp;future-ready</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Department Aims and Objectives</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Science and Environment Department aims to :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>stimulate students’ curiosity and passion for science and environmental issues through&nbsp;meaningful, authentic experiences</li>
<li>nurture&nbsp;reflective thinkers&nbsp;who ask scientific questions and appreciate how science affects their lives, society and the environment</li>
<li>develop&nbsp;scientific literacy&nbsp;in learners to face the challenges of the future&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three integral domains in the diagram are essential in the practice of science in Sengkang Green Primary School. <br>These domains; (a) Authentic Experiences, (b) Reflection and (c) Scientific Literacy, are interdependently connected to enable our students to view science as meaningful and purposeful.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Blended Inquiry Learning</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><br>Blended Inquiry Learning is an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning that engages students intellectually and fosters their understanding of science concepts. The key focus is to provide a customized curriculum facilitated with technology in a blended learning environment. The programme will provide a platform for our students to work collaboratively with one another and further demonstrate the ICAR<sup>2</sup>E Values. Students will be encouraged to be inquisitive, inspire one another and be innovative. <br><strong><br></strong><strong>2. Back 2 Nature</strong><br><br>The Back 2 Nature programme aims to nurture the naturalistic instinct in students and curiosity about the natural world by immersing them in authentic out-of-classroom experiences. Student are encouraged to constantly question their observations and appreciate the need for continuity and survival of living organisms. Students will experience the process of planting vegetables hydroponically and learn about food security, appreciate food better and reduce food wastage. They display their caring values by donating the harvest to elderly home. Students will be given opportunities to take ownership of their learning and make meaning from these experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Thinking Like a Scientist</strong></p>
<p><br>The Thinking Like a Scientist programme focuses on development of concepts and skills in scientific literacy. Students assume the role of scientists, and engage in the processes necessary to solve problems, make decisions and take actions about the natural world and the changes made through human activity.</p>

<p><strong><u>Key Event <br></u></strong><strong><br>iDiscovery Week</strong></p>
<p>iDiscovery Week aims to stimulate students’ interest in science. We believe learning should be fun and engaging. It is also important to consolidate learning and be able to express themselves. The activities are planned to enable students to conduct research and be involved in active inquiry. Students showcase projects and share their findings. In the spirit of healthy competition, students work together to question, observe, record and make sense of what they find. In the process, students collaborate, discuss and make decisions in a fun and engaging environment.</p>

<p>All staff and students pledge in efforts to raise public issues about environmental issues such as the 3Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle), Climate Change, Conservation and the SGClean campaign. Students learn and share how they can play a part in water and energy conservation efforts and raise awareness with their peers and family. In addition, students are encouraged to reduce food wastage and learn how discarded food waste turn into compost which is a mixture that consists mainly of decayed organic things and is usually used for fertilising. Through various platforms, we hope to change human behavior and better understand the urgency of spreading the message so that collectively, everyone can play a part to make the Earth safe and healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

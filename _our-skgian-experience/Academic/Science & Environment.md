<br><strong><u>Vision</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Inquiring Minds, Critical Thinkers, Environmental Advocates</p>
<p><strong><u>Mission</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture&nbsp;passionate,&nbsp;caring, and&nbsp;inquisitive learners&nbsp;for
the&nbsp;environment and conservation&nbsp;and show&nbsp;appreciation for
the beauty&nbsp;and&nbsp;wonders of science&nbsp;and have the&nbsp;skills
of a critical and scientifically literate individual&nbsp;to be&nbsp;future-ready</p>
<p><strong><u>Department Aims and Objectives</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Science and Environment Department aims to :</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>stimulate students’ curiosity and passion for science and environmental
issues through&nbsp;meaningful, authentic experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nurture&nbsp;reflective thinkers&nbsp;who ask scientific questions and
appreciate how science affects their lives, society and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop&nbsp;scientific literacy&nbsp;in learners to face the challenges
of the future&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The three integral domains in the diagram are essential in the practice
of science in Sengkang Green Primary School.
<br>These domains; (a) Authentic Experiences, (b) Reflection and (c) Scientific
Literacy, are interdependently connected to enable our students to view
science as meaningful and purposeful.</p>

<p><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Blended Inquiry Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>Blended Inquiry Learning is an inquiry-based approach to teaching and
learning that engages students intellectually and fosters their understanding
of science concepts. The key focus is to provide a customized curriculum
facilitated with technology in a blended learning environment. The programme
will provide a platform for our students to work collaboratively with one
another and further demonstrate the ICAR2E Values. Students will be encouraged
to be inquisitive, inspire one another and be innovative.
<br><strong><br>2. Back 2 Nature</strong>
<br>
<br>The Back 2 Nature programme aims to nurture the naturalistic instinct
in students and curiosity about the natural world by immersing them in
authentic out-of-classroom experiences. Student are encouraged to constantly
question their observations and appreciate the need for continuity and
survival of living organisms. Students will experience the process of planting
vegetables hydroponically and learn about food security, appreciate food
better and reduce food wastage. They display their caring values by donating
the harvest to elderly home. Students will be given opportunities to take
ownership of their learning and make meaning from these experiences.</p>

<p><strong>3. Thinking Like a Scientist</strong>
</p>
<p>The Thinking Like a Scientist programme focuses on development of concepts
and skills in scientific literacy. Students assume the role of scientists,
and engage in the processes necessary to solve problems, make decisions
and take actions about the natural world and the changes made through human
activity.</p>

<p><strong><u>Key Event <br></u><br>iDiscovery Week</strong>
</p>
<p>iDiscovery Week aims to stimulate students’ interest in science. We believe
learning should be fun and engaging. It is also important to consolidate
learning and be able to express themselves. The activities are planned
to enable students to conduct research and be involved in active inquiry.
Students showcase projects and share their findings. In the spirit of healthy
competition, students work together to question, observe, record and make
sense of what they find. In the process, students collaborate, discuss
and make decisions in a fun and engaging environment.</p>

<p><strong><u>Eco-stewardship Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In line with the national sustainability agenda, Singapore Green Plan
2030, SKGPS aims to develop students from young an awareness on the issue
of environment conservation and sustainability through an integrated 4Cs
(Curriculum, Culture, Community and Campus) approach.</p>

<p>All staff and students pledge in efforts to raise public issues about
environmental issues such as the 3Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle), Climate
Change, Conservation and the SGClean campaign. Students learn and share
how they can play a part in water and energy conservation efforts and raise
awareness with their peers and family. In addition, students are encouraged
to reduce food wastage and learn how discarded food waste turn into compost
which is a mixture that consists mainly of decayed organic things and is
usually used for fertilising. Through various platforms, we hope to change
human behavior and better understand the urgency of spreading the message
so that collectively, everyone can play a part to make the Earth safe and
healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

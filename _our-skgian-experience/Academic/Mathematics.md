<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Every SKGian is a&nbsp;<strong>Confident&nbsp;Problem Solver</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture numeracy, logical reasoning and problem solving skills and
interest in learning in our students so that they are ready for everyday
life and learning at the next level and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Department Aims</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>At the end of Primary 6, our students will:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continue
learning in mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop critical thinking, reasoning, communication, problem solving and
metacognitive skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultivate curiosity and foster interest in mathematics; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>become independent and self-directed learners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Learning Experiences and Key Programmes<br><br>Learning Experiences</strong>
<br>It matters how our students learn.
<br>Mathematical concepts are abstract. To develop an understanding of these
abstract concepts, it is necessary to start from concrete objects, examples
and experiences that students can relate to. Therefore, learning experiences
are sequenced based on Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach.</p>
<p>Different concepts require different approaches. The instructional strategies
and resources selected in designing learning experiences take into consideration
of the nature of the concepts. Below are some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Learning about Numbers</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learn by doing and applying learning. They use concrete manipulatives
and pictorial representations such as fraction bars, number discs and number
bonds to get a sense of the number concepts. They are then guided to connect
the concrete and pictorial experiences to the abstract concept by explaining,
reasoning and applying the concepts and skills to new problems. This way,
students make meaning of the operations and algorithms involving numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Learning about Geometry and Measurements</strong>
</p>
<p>Students explore, investigate and discover geometric shapes and properties
and measurements through hands-on activities.</p>
<p>They discover and justify how formulas such as area of triangles and circles
come about the use of concrete models and manipulatives and online applets.</p>

<p><strong>Learning about Statistics</strong>
</p>
<p>Students carry out simple surveys that involve data collection and use
of ICT tools to generate tables and graphs to represent the data. In the
process, students discuss and pose questions to deepen learning about reading,
comparing and analyzing data, for example, “What data to collect’, ‘what
is the purpose?’ and ‘How to present the data to convey the information
gathered most clearly and effectively’.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Solving</strong> 
<br>Mathematical problem-solving is a central focus of the mathematics curriculum.
It involves the application of mathematical concepts and skills to solve
a variety of problems including routine and familiar, non-routine, open-ended
and unfamiliar problems. Therefore, students are taught general problem-solving
strategies such as heuristics and ways of thinking and approaching a problem.
They will also learn how to approach problems systematically. For example,
students are introduced to the George Polya’s four-step problem solving
process in class and heuristics such as working backwards, guess and check,
systematic listing, making supposition, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Mastery Phase of learning</strong>
</p>
<p>We strive to enable all students achieve academic mastery. At the end
of learning key concepts, skills or problem solving skills, students consolidate
and extend their learning which include one or more of the following: &nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Consistent and motivated practice with understanding is emphasized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students consolidate and deepen their learning through tasks that allow
them to reflect on their learning. This is a habit that supports the development
of metacognition. Examples are the use of note-taking and consolidation
in math journal book and self and peer assessment checklist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who are more mathematically inclined will have opportunities
to extend their learning by engaging in more challenging tasks that stretch
their thinking and deepen their understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathematics Olympiad Programme<br></strong>The Mathematics Olympiad
programme provides opportunities for students who are more mathematically
inclined to in P4, P5 and P6 to extend their learning. Students are exposed
to higher-order thinking problems and are equipped with a repertoire of
problem-solving strategies and higher-order thinking skills to engage in
problem solving. In the programme, students are expected to reason, justify
and explain their solutions to their peers. These enable students to sharpen
their mathematical thinking, reasoning, communication and problem-solving
skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Mathematics Trail<br></strong>Mathematics Trail in SKGPS provides
students with the opportunity to relate mathematical concepts and skills
that they have learnt to the real world. Students work in teams to apply
mathematical concepts and skills such as the use of mathematical tools
and estimation to complete authentic learning tasks within the school compound.
Learning of mathematics becomes fun, meaningful and relevant for the students.&nbsp;

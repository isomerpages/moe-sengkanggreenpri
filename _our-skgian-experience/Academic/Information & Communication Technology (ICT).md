<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Coding</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Code for Fun program, offered jointly by IMDA and Ministry of Education
(MOE), aims to expose primary school students to computational thinking
through coding, inventive thinking through digital making and emerging
technologies. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Home-Based Learning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) provides a platform for students to learn in
settings beyond school through a blend of online and offline activities.
These activities complement in-school learning and are designed to develop
students' ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners.
These self-directed experiences will also encourage the development of
positive habits in learning, such as setting of learning goals and monitoring
of one’s learning progress.</p>
The following are key aspects of learning that may be retained as far
as possible during HBL:<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. &nbsp; delivery of content for learning;<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. interaction for learning between students and teachers as well as among students;<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. formative evaluation of learning to check understanding; and<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. remediation to meet students’ needs.
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Cyber Wellness Program</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming increasingly
pervasive in our world. While creating instant connectivity and access
to vast repositories of information, knowledge, and opinions, the open
nature of the Internet can expose our students to undesirable content and
influences.</p>
<p>Our whole-school Cyber Wellness program focuses on the well-being of our
students as they navigate cyberspace. The program aims to equip students
with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive
purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible
users of ICT.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Department Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Engaged 21st&nbsp;Century EL Learners</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>To&nbsp;develop&nbsp;<em>empathetic communicators</em>,&nbsp;<em>discerning readers</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>creative inquirers</em>&nbsp;who
have&nbsp;<em>strong fundamentals</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>21st&nbsp;century competencies</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Read@SKGPS Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that reading helps our students to be future-ready learner
by building their language skills and perspective-taking skills. Thus,
the reading habit and the love for reading should be cultivated since young.
To this end, we have collaborated with the National Library Board (NLB)
on various reading programmes and activities to get our students engaged
and motivated to read. Reading is a huge part of the English Language curriculum
and teachers conduct&nbsp;regular reading periods during which both teachers
and students read for a period of time, hold book talks, do book presentations
or engage in reading activities.</p>

<p><strong>Supplementary Reading Programme&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>To promote a positive attitude towards reading, we weave reading into
the daily life of our students. An inviting reading corner is a staple
feature in the classroom where students can look forward to reading a wide
variety of books. In addition, we provide access to quality fiction and
non-fiction texts for all our students through the Supplementary Reading
Programme. Our students subscribe to graded readers and student-friendly
newspapers which are used by teachers to teach language skills in class.</p>
<p><strong>P1 and P2 Speech and Drama Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>All our P1 and P2 students attend Speech and Drama lessons during curriculum
time to develop communication and collaborative skills. The programme aims
to develop our students into confident communicators as Speech and Drama
integrates reading, speaking and listening skills. All our students learn
to enjoy the English Language in a creative environment. They especially
enjoy having the opportunity to showcase their skills and talents in a
class performance with their parents as their enthusiastic and supportive
audience. By getting the students involved in an authentic cooperative
activity to develop their confidence, we hope to excite our students in
language learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Literature Programme&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students are introduced to literature study from Primary Three to
Primary Five. Through the study of literature, our students learn about
the purpose of reading – understanding and appreciating a writer's use
of language to hook an audience of readers. Literature also shows our students
how writing entails making choices to create an impact on the reader. Through
literature, the study of the forms and structures of language – vocabulary,
grammar and syntax – is transformed into something living and relevant
to the learner’s need to communicate effectively in a complex world.&nbsp;Beyond
expanding our students’ literacy skills and vocabulary, literature is also
widely known to develop empathy and a deeper understanding of the world
around us as our students explore themes and character studies.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Support Programme 2.0 (LSP 2.0)</strong>
</p>
<p>The LSP for English, a specialised early intervention programme, provides
additional support for students with weak literacy skills. Students attend
lessons for one period a day in small groups, and are taught by specially
trained teachers using strategies that will improve their reading ability.
More attention is given to equipping our students with basic literacy skills
so they can access learning in the regular classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme 2.0 (SDR 2.0)</strong>
</p>
<p>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme 2.0 is a specialised
and intensive literacy intervention programme. It targets Primary 3 and
4 students with dyslexia, particularly those with significant difficulties
in reading and spelling. The programme is conducted in small groups by
trained school personnel using an evidence-based and learner-centered pedagogy,
coupled with explicit, systematic and multisensory teaching. The programme
enables students to (1) become confident readers, building on their knowledge
of letter sounds to read long words and age-appropriate texts; (2) become
confident spellers, flexible in the use of different strategies to spell
complex words; and (3) develop their understanding of a variety of texts,
using a range of comprehension strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reading Remediation Programme 2.0 (RRP 2.0)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to provide support for P3
and P4 students who still face consistent difficulty in reading in the
English Language despite having completed the Learning Support Programme
in P1 and P2. The programme exposes students to a range of coping strategies
for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their
learning in the regular classroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

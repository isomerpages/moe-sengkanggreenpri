<p><strong>Aims &amp; Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop students into confident and competent Tamil Language users
who appreciate the Tamil culture and values. Through interesting and enriching
activities, we hope our students can develop
<br>a love for both the language and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>To provide students with a strong foundation in the 6 skills of the language,
namely; Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing, Oral and Written Communication.</p>
<p><strong>Our Strategies</strong>

<p>In alignment to the school’s Teaching and Learning Framework, the department
engages the students in learning through the following ways:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use a repertoire of school-wide student-centric pedagogies to make student
learning visible through strategies such as Cooperative Learning, Collaborative
Learning and Differentiated Instruction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage on students’ familiarity and regular use of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) in Mother Tongue Language (MTL) learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create platforms and opportunities that encourage students to use their
MTL to communicate proficiently in everyday life and&nbsp;to develop a
deeper appreciation of their culture.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Reading Programme</u>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As reading is one of the essential ways to building competency in a language,
the Tamil Language Department runs a structured reading programme for all
students. Every week, one period is set aside for our Reading Programme.
Students will engage in various activities after reading a book. Students
can borrow a book from either the school or the class library for the reading
session. This year, our students will be exposed to the following:</p>
<p>1) உள்ளூர் சிறுவர் எழுத்தாளர்கள்
<br>2) எ. சகாதேவன்/
<br>3) உமா பதிப்பகம்</p>

<li>
<p><u>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</u>
</p>

</ol>
<p>To inculcate both awareness and appreciation of the Tamil language and
culture, we have prepared an extensive range of activities for all our
students including story recitation of different genres, singing of cultural
and children songs, Kolam drawing, learning about traditional Indian delicacies,
language games and traditional Indian games.</p>
<p>All these activities will help to give students a better understanding
of both the Tamil language and culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
<p>Proactive empathetic engagement approach to holistic student well-being management.</p>
<p>As student <strong>well-being</strong> is a whole-school approach, the Student Development Department comprises a big team of Key Personnel and staff members to provide students @ SKGPS with an emotionally and physically safe learning environment, one which is conducive for them to grow and be nurtured into future-ready leaders with a growth mindset.</p>
<p>At SKGPS, we believe that a caring culture supports the well-being of students and encourages growth and development of unique personalities every possible way. All students will receive adequate and well-timed support for their learning and growth. Individualized help will be given to mitigate physical, psychological or social problems to guide our students to live up to the school’s vision and mission.</p>
<p>The education landscape in Singapore has changed and is changing rapidly in recent years due to globalisation. At SKGPS, we acknowledge that the pace of change in acquiring the relevant skills can be joyful to students if they are equipped with the required social-emotional skills, develop their personal leadership traits to stay healthy and happy individuals with the strength of character, Ready to serve &amp; ready for the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>POSITIVE DISCIPLINE </u></strong></p>

<p><em>Adapted from MOE Discipline Resource Portal</em><img alt="" src="/images/sm0001.png"></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The school believes in <strong>Connection before Correction</strong> and uses the <strong>Restorative Practices</strong> approaches to teach our SKGians to be self-disciplined.&nbsp; SKGians are also taught about making good choices and the importance of taking personal responsibility for their actions in and out of school.</p>
<p>The school has adopted three empowering beliefs and four empowering skills from the book Positive Discipline that help our students succeed in school and life.</p>
<p><strong><u>Three Empowering Beliefs that help students succeed in school and life.</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I am capable</li>
<li>I contribute in meaningful ways and I am genuinely needed</li>
<li>I use my personal power to make choices that positively influence what happens to me and my peers / community</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Four Empowering Skills that help students succeed in school and life.</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I have discipline and self-control</li>
<li>I can work respectfully with others</li>
<li>I understand how my behavior affects others</li>
<li>I can develop wisdom and judgement skills through daily practice</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><u>STUDENT LEADERSHIP</u></strong></p>
<img alt="" src="/images/sm0002.png">

<p><strong><u>Our Beliefs and Guiding Principles</u></strong></p>
<p>At Sengkang Green Primary School, we believe that leadership can be nurtured and all students have the potential to be developed as leaders. The student leadership development (SLD) at SKGPS focuses on cultivating students’ personal leadership which lead to self-mastery and <strong>student agency</strong>, before leading others as a servant leader.</p>
<p>The SLD is intentionally designed to facilitate all students to discover the leader within themselves. It is guided by two beliefs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every SKGian student can be developed as a leader</li>
<li>Every SKGian student is a servant leader that goes beyond self</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
<p><strong>“THE SKGIAN LEADER BEGINS WITH ME”</strong> is a three-prong approach in preparing our students to lead themselvess and contribute positively to those around them, in school and beyond.</p>
<p>Following the framework of <strong>Discover - Develop – Distinguish</strong>, it begins with equipping every student with the basic leadership skills to lead oneself first before leading others. Opportunities and space are provided for students to <strong>discover</strong> their leadership self and <strong>develop</strong> a spectrum of leadership competencies in order to be able to lead others effectively and impact the school and community.</p>

<p><strong>PEER Support Relationship </strong></p>
<p>Apart from teachers and school counsellors, peers are the next best people to provide social and emotional support from student to student in need or distress.&nbsp; Peers are generally aware of what their friends are going through and therefore in the best position to alert teachers and school counsellors when they notice their friends encounter difficulties and are not coping well.&nbsp; Also, students will turn to peers when they are experiencing worry, frustration or concerns and are more comfortable in talking openly with them.&nbsp; With this initial disclosure, peers can offer emotional support and advise their friends to seek help.&nbsp;Recognising the impact a student can have on its peers, the school has embarked on a 2-tiered approach.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> is School-Wide Approach where students learn Peer bonding, Peer helping &amp; Peer Influencing skills during FTGP lessons. This leads to their self-mastery and promotes <strong>student agency. </strong></p>
<img alt="" src="/images/sm0008.png">
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> involves a selected group of Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) for peer support. This is to further strengthen the student-student relationship (SSR) among peers, as well as, to foster a culture of care and inclusiveness within the school.</p>

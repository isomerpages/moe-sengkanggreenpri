<p>We are guided by the CCE Curriculum Framework, which is based on the belief
that education is about developing the child holistically. Centred on the
SKGPS vision and mission, this framework focuses on the knowledge, skills
and values which we aim to inculcate in our students to equip them to be
citizens of good character.</p>

<p><strong>CCE/MTL Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE/MTL lessons focus on developing the moral well-being of our students
by helping them acquire and live by the values that guide them to make
appropriate choices that determine their behaviours and attitudes towards
themselves and the environment. Lessons in CCE/MTL use stories, scenarios,
songs and games, Lessons are designed to reinforce teaching and learning
of values, develop social-emotional competencies and nurture citizenship
dispositions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Social Studies<br></strong>The Social Studies curriculum spans
the primary and secondary levels, and helps students to grow in knowledge,
develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern
to our society and the world in which we live. Through inquiry-based learning
and authentic learning experiences, we hope to ignite students’ interest
in real-world issues that concern them.</p>
<p>The knowledge, skills and values gained from Social Studies, together
with the citizenship dispositions that National Education is anchored on,
will help students become citizens who are informed, concerned and participative.</p>

the next chapter of Singapore. NE is then anchored on the following citizenship
dispositions, which will enable our students to realise their part in flourishing

<p><strong>Learning Journeys (LJs)</strong>
</p>
<p>LJs aim to instil in our students, pride in Singapore’s achievements,
to help them understand Singapore’s constraints, challenges and opportunities,
build their confidence in our future, and nurture a sense of belonging
to Singapore.</p>
<p>Inherent in the concept of LJs is the belief that every trip undertaken
by our students out of the school is an important learning experience that
will link the theoretical with the experiential - injecting life and meaning
to the learning so that it becomes real and concrete. By visiting key installations
in Singapore, our students will get see the principles and theories learnt
in the classroom and textbooks applied in real life situations, and understand
that meritocracy, hard work, the desire to excel, and readiness to take
calculated risks have allowed us to overcome many constraints and turn
challenges into opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong>
<br>In our efforts to nurture our students to become active contributors and
concerned citizens of the future, the school has adopted a 6-year spiral
developmental plan in the implementation of its VIA Programme.&nbsp;Our
VIA activities are designed with a focus on the home, school and the community
&amp; the nation.&nbsp;Through the VIA learning experiences, our students
are encouraged to identify and understand community issues, initiate actions
among peers and improve the lives of others. Throughout the process, students
reflect on what they have learnt and how they can continue to make a difference
to others.</p>

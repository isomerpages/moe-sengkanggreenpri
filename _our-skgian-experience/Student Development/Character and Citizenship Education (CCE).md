<p><strong>CCE/MTL Lessons</strong>
<br>CCE/MTL lessons focus on developing the moral well-being of our students
by helping them acquire and live by the values that guide them to make
appropriate choices that determine their behaviours and attitudes towards
themselves and the environment. Lessons in CCE/MTL use stories, scenarios,
songs and games, Lessons are designed to reinforce teaching and learning
of values, develop social-emotional competencies and nurture citizenship
dispositions.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies</strong>
<br>The Social Studies curriculum spans
the primary and secondary levels, and helps students to grow in knowledge,
develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern
to our society and the world in which we live. Through inquiry-based learning
and authentic learning experiences, we hope to ignite students’ interest
in real-world issues that concern them.</p>
<p>The knowledge, skills and values gained from Social Studies, together
with the citizenship dispositions that National Education is anchored on,
will help students become citizens who are informed, concerned and participative.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>The main objective of these Learning Journeys is for our children to understand
what makes Singapore tick, to understand why we are where we are today.
They illustrate our vision and planning and reflect our society's character.
Our children must learn about them, understand their significance, and
think about the part that they themselves can play to ensure that in our
journey into the future Singapore continues to stay strong as a nation
and to make progress.</p>
<p>Learning Journeys aim to instill in our students, pride in Singapore’s
achievements, to help them understand Singapore’s constraints, challenges
and opportunities, build their confidence in our future, and nurture a
sense of belonging to Singapore.</p>
<p>Inherent in the concept of Learning Journeys is the belief that every
trip undertaken by the students out of the school is an important learning
experience that will link the theoretical with the experiential - injecting
life and meaning to the learning so that it becomes real and concrete.
By visiting key installations in Singapore, the students will get see the
principles and theories learnt in the classroom and textbooks applied in
real life situations, and understand that meritocracy, hard work, the desire
to excel, and readiness to take calculated risks have allowed us to overcome
many constraints and turn challenges into opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong>
<br>In our efforts to nurture our students to become active contributors and
concerned citizens of the future, the school has adopted a 6-year spiral
developmental plan in the implementation of its Values In Action Programme.
Over the years, we have evolved due the changing landscape and will require
our students to embrace the citizenry dispositions such as a sense of belonging,
a sense of reality, a sense of hope and the will to act to return serve
back to themselves and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our VIA activities are designed with a focus on the home, school and the
community &amp; the nation. Through the VIA learning experiences, students
are encouraged to identify and understand community issues, initiate actions
among peers and improve the lives of others. Throughout the process, students
reflect on what they have learnt and how they can continue to make a difference
to others.</p>

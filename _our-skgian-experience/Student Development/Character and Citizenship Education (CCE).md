<p><br> <strong>Our Mission&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To inculcate values and build competencies in our students to equip them with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values to be responsible citizens who serve beyond self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our CCE Goals </strong></p>
<img alt="" src="images\cce002.png">
<p>CCE in Sengkang Green anchors on the school mission to develop our students into Leaders of Character and Socially Responsible Citizens who actively contribute to the school, community and nation. We emphasise on the interconnectedness of the core values, 21<sup>st&nbsp;</sup>century competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical to develop student into a confident person, self-directed learner, concerned citizen and an active contributor.</p>

<p><strong>Values-based Assembly / Form Teacher Guidance (FTGP Programme)/HEART to Heart Programme.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="images\cce004.png">
<p>Anchored on the school’s ICAR<sup>2</sup>E values, and the SEL Competencies framework, the weekly 1-hour school assembly programme alternates with the FTGP lessons to teach&nbsp;school values, social-emotional competencies, Habits &amp; Routines and Life Skills.</p>
<p>FTGP and Heart-to-Heart programmes optimise opportunities for teachers to build positive relationship with their students. It provides quality interaction time for form teachers to engage in meaningful conversations with their students and future build on their 5 Social Emotional Competencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lessons are designed for students to acquire skills that will help them to:</p>
<p>a) better understand themselves (Self-Awareness)</p>
<p>b) learn ways to manage themselves (Self-Management)</p>
<p>c) better understand their family and friends (Social Awareness)</p>
<p>d) learn ways to work with their family and friends (Relationship Management) and</p>
<p>e) make appropriate and responsible decisions (Responsible Decision Making)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CCE Lessons</strong></p>
<p>CCE lessons focus on developing the moral well-being of our students by helping them acquire and live by the values that guide them to make appropriate choices that determine their behaviours and attitudes towards themselves, others and the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies<br> </strong>The Social Studies&nbsp;curriculum spans the primary and secondary levels, and helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which we live. Through inquiry-based learning and authentic learning experiences, we hope to ignite students’ interest in real-world issues that concern them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The knowledge, skills and values gained from Social Studies, together with the citizenship dispositions that National Education is anchored on, will help students become citizens who&nbsp;are informed, concerned and participative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National Education (NE) Programme</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of National Education is to develop &amp; inspire our students to take collective ownership of their future as a nation and to co construct the next chapter of Singapore. NE is then anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which will enable our students to realise their part in flourishing of the community and nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NE Commemorative Events</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The four core NE events that the school commemorates are Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. During these events, the school will organise many interesting, fun and meaningful activities to foster a sense of pride and belonging to our country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning Journeys (LJs)</strong></p>
<p>LJs aim to instil in our students, pride in Singapore’s achievements, to help them understand Singapore’s constraints, challenges and opportunities, build their confidence in our future, and nurture a sense of belonging to Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inherent in the concept of LJs is the belief that every trip undertaken by our students out of the school is an important learning experience that will link the theoretical with the experiential - injecting life and meaning to the learning so that it becomes real and concrete. By visiting key installations in Singapore, our students will get see the principles and theories learnt in the classroom and textbooks applied in real life situations, and understand that meritocracy, hard work, the desire to excel, and readiness to take calculated risks have allowed us to overcome many constraints and turn challenges into opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In our efforts to nurture our students to become active contributors and concerned citizens of the future, the school has adopted a 6-year spiral developmental plan in the implementation of its VIA Programme.&nbsp;Our VIA activities are designed with a focus on the home, school and the community &amp; the nation.&nbsp;Through the VIA learning experiences, our students are encouraged to identify and understand community issues, initiate actions among peers and improve the lives of others. Throughout the process, students reflect on what they have learnt and how they can continue to make a difference to others.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics Overview:</strong><strong><br> </strong><br> In Sengkang Green, we strongly believe in the importance of developing every child holistically.&nbsp; The arts education (Visual Art and Performing Art) not only plays an important role in providing a vibrant art experience for our SKGians but is also an invaluable vehicle through which character and competencies can be developed.&nbsp;SKGians are given opportunities to explore different art forms with increasing levels of mastery. In doing so, our SKGians develop a deep interest and appreciation in the arts, thus&nbsp;equipping with the necessary knowledge and skills to further develop their interests in the various fields of arts.&nbsp;<br> <br> Through a specialised school-based arts curriculum, SKGians acquire visual arts and performing arts skills in the various modules.</p>
<p><strong>Our Sengkang Green Arts Curriculum is based on 2-pronged approaches - Grow with Arts and Grow through Arts.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Grow with Arts:</strong><br>Grow with Arts caters to our structured arts programmes targeted at developing every SKGian’s ability to express ideas and appreciation for beauty, culture and traditions. The focus on local music in the performing arts domain and close observation of famous artistic styles in the visual arts domain are efforts to heighten our SKGians’ awareness of the arts around us. Subsequently, SKGians will participate in fun and interesting activities in art making and music making, using different media, materials and instruments which are age appropriate and caters to their level of development in the arts.</p>

<p><strong>Grow Through Arts</strong><br>At Sengkang Green, we believe that a quality Arts education goes beyond the development of art and music knowledge and skills. Participation in art activities, collaborations in art and music making are excellent ways for character building. Through their active involvement and collaboration in music appreciation, performance and visual art projects, SKGians will develop a strong character centered on the school’s ICAR&nbsp;<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>E values. They will also acquire life skills as they learn and share together in meaningful activities that would help prepare them to be ready for service and for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Visual Art Curriculum:</strong></p>
<p>The SKGPS Visual Art Curriculum aims to enable every child to enjoy art, communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. By the end of&nbsp; 6 years of Visual Art education, SKGians will become Active Artists and Informed Audience who are able to See, Express and Appreciate art; these domains present learning opportunities to develop key competencies of observe-inquire, create-innovate and connect-respond. Through the various visual art modules, students will be exposed to 4 key-learning content components: Context, Artistic Processes, Visual Qualities and Media.</p>

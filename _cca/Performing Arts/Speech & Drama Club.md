<p>The Speech &amp; Drama Club is a fun and exciting CCA where students are encouraged to be creative and confident individuals, able to express themselves using various drama techniques.</p>
<p>In this CCA, students explore various drama and presentation skills such as Miming, Script Writing, Tableaux, Soundscape, Dialogues and Improvisation. Students will also learn about the different types of theatre such as Forum Theatre and Physical Theatre.</p>
<p>The Speech &amp; Drama Club trains our young performers to develop enquiry and communication skills. Our members get the opportunity to watch a professional drama production at least once a year in order to learn from the experts in the drama scene.</p>
<p>Our members also showcase their talents in productions staged within and beyond our school.</p>

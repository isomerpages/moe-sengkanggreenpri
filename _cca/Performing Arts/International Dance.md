<p>The International Dance CCA introduces pupils to a wide genre of dance forms which are non-ethnic in nature. These include fusions of ballet, jazz, contemporary and hip hop dances. Through dance, pupils build technical skills in coordination, flexibility, spatial creativity and sense of rhythm.</p>
<p>In the process of practising and performing together, our young dancers learn the importance of discipline and active teamwork, while developing a love for dance, movements and appreciation for different dances.</p>

<p>The Sengkang Green Primary Wushu CCA, founded in 2017, aims to promote Chinese culture and the spirit of traditional martial arts. Through this ancient sport, students not only learn how to keep fit but also improve one&rsquo;s flexibility, strength, speed, endurance and coordination. They also develop social awareness by synergizing as a team, recognizing and accepting differences in others and helping each other to achieve success. Through the trainings, students have the opportunity to learn basic fist and weapons routine. Students also learn how to handle weapons with care.</p>

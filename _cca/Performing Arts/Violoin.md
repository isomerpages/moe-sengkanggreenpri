<p>The violin CCA aims to equip pupils who have the passion for classical music with the skills and techniques in playing the violin.Through practising and playing together, the ensemble harnesses and hones our pupils&rsquo; skills so that they become confident musicians, with a deep appreciation for classical music and the ability to perform in a team.</p>
<p>Through the participation in the CCA, pupils are taught the different aspects of musical theory and performance directions. Apart from the practical and theoretical musical knowledge, pupils also learn to work together in an ensemble and develop confidence and responsibility through performances.</p>

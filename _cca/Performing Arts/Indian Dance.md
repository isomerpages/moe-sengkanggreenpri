<p>The Indian Dance was formed in 2015 to cater to the passion of the dancers in SKG. The CCA provides an opportunity for pupils to appreciate the vibrant mix of fine aesthetics and energy of the Indian culture. These exciting characteristics have attracted children of different races to join the CCA. Through the active participation in the CCA, pupils build confidence and develop a sense of aesthetics appreciation in the performing arts as well as for the Indian Culture. The Indian dance CCA has done the school proud with her achievements and performances at the many platforms.</p>

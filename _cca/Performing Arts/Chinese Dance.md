<p>The Chinese Dance CCA provides a platform for students to cultivate an understanding and appreciation of Chinese culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunities are provided for students to perform at internal school based events as well as participate in external stage performances and competitions. Through dance education, we hope to build self-confidence, instil the values of resilience and active teamwork in our students.</p>

<p>The Choir introduces pupils to the wonders of using their voices as a natural bodily instrument. Through choral singing, pupils are able to develop the different techniques of vocal projection, accurate pitching and diction while building confidence and musicality.</p>
<p>As a group of young singers, pupils learn to respect the different roles that each section has and understand the importance of active teamwork in singing harmoniously together. With the skills and right values woven together, their voices strike a melodious chord together.</p>

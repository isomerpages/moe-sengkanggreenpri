<p>The Art club provides opportunities for pupils who have an interest in the visual arts to develop their artistic skills to the fullest through hands-on experience in different art forms and in using different medium.</p>
<p>With the objectives to inculcate an eye for aesthetical appreciation, pupils in the art club go in depth into different art forms and explore the different interactions between media. Pupils gain greater understanding through learning journeys and art video discussions which are implemented to enhance the learning of art beyond the classroom. These activities promote teamwork, inculcate respect for different art forms and nurture pupils into life-long learners in Art.</p>

<p>In Green Sparks, pupils explore the roles and benefits of plants in the environment. Through hands-on experiences in gardening and learning journeys, pupils understand the importance of conserving the environment to protect the diversity of living things around them. Pupils also go through how scientists work as they get curious with their environment, raise questions and make attempts to answer their questions through investigative experiments.</p>

<p>The Robotics CCA provides our pupils with the opportunity to learn about robot mechanism and engineering in an inter-disciplinary and problem-based learning environment. Pupils are exposed to Lego creation and construction while undergoing a series of interesting and fun-filled activities using LEGO EV3, an interactive learning tool for robotics.</p>
<p>The Robotics CCA is an excellent platform to generate interest and to engage pupils in developing useful skills, encourage active teamwork and promote critical and inventive thinking to meet future challenges.</p>

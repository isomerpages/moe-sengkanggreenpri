<p>The New Media Club aims to develop SKGians as competent and confident media users in the digital age. Through their active participation in the CCA, pupils are exposed to and acquire various multimedia skills such as photography and animation. These pupils become active contributors to the community, applying their skills in positive and meaningful ways.</p>

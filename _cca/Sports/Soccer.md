<p>The football CCA is a popular choice among the boys in SKGPS. The boys
are introduced to the different aspects of the game, from the rules, the
footwork, the ball skills to the tactics and strategies when facing an
opponent.</p>
<p>Apart from the knowledge and understanding, the CCA aims to inculcate
footballers with the school values of integrity in fair play and responsibility
for oneself and team mates during training sessions in order to play successfully
and safely.</p>

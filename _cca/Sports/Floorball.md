<p>Floorball is gaining popularity in the Singapore local sports scene as well as among students of SKGPS. It is a fast-paced and exciting sport played indoors.</p>
<p>In SKGPS, our students learn beyond fundamentals of passing, shooting and ball control. Students learn to understand the game of floorball, its rules and regulations, through small sided game-play during training.</p>
<p>During our CCA sessions, the teachers and coaches place great emphasis on school values such as active teamwork, respect for oneself, teammates and opponents so that students can play and learn safely.</p>

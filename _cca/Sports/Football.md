<p>The football CCA is a popular choice among the boys in SKGPS. The boys are introduced to the different aspects of the game, from the rules, the footwork, the ball skills to the tactics and strategies when facing an opponent.</p>
<p>Apart from the knowledge and understanding, the CCA aims to inculcate footballers with the school values of integrity in fair play and responsibility for oneself and team mates during training sessions in order to play successfully and safely.</p>

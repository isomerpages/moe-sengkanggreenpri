<p>Message from the Principal for 2022<br /><strong><em>School Theme 2022: &ldquo;We are ready to serve&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>Dear Parents and Visitors to the website,</p>
<p><strong>Best new year wishes to you and your family in 2022!</strong></p>
<p>Sengkang Green Primary School started in 2013 as a new school in Sengkang. Today, it is a primary school well-regarded by parents and the community. The MOE Kindergarten @ Sengkang Green is a part of Sengkang Green Primary School.</p>
<p>Sengkang Green&rsquo;s mission is to&nbsp;<strong>nurture healthy &amp; happy individuals</strong>&nbsp;with strength of character, ready to serve, ready for the future through the following emphases:</p>
<ol>
<li>To instil sound values in SKGians and develop in them a strong character and citizenship;</li>
<li>To develop a strong foundation in the academic subjects and through it achieve academic mastery and excellence to facilitate lifelong learning;</li>
<li>To cultivate SKGians&rsquo; interest and passion and develop their talents through Physical Education, Art and Music (PAM), Co-curricular Activities (CCA), Learning for Life Programme (LLP), and enrichment programmes;</li>
<li>To develop a holistic system of care that provides integrated support for SKGians to help them make progress in learning; and</li>
<li>To nurture 21st Century competencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>The theme for 2022 is&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;We are ready to serve&rdquo;</strong>.&nbsp;We aspire to continue the school&rsquo;s emphasis on the&nbsp;<strong>character development</strong>&nbsp;of SKGians. Sengkang Green seeks to empower SKGians to practise&nbsp;<strong>responsible decision-making</strong>, a key competency which contributes to their Social Emotional Learning.</p>
<p>The theme draws reference from the school&rsquo;s mission to equip SKGians to&nbsp;<strong>be ready to serve</strong>&nbsp;with a other-centred mindset. SKGians will be guided by the school&rsquo;s ICAR<sup>2</sup>E values and see themselves as capable of contributing to the well-being of others in their family, school, community, nation and beyond. They will learn and practise empathy. As they learn to consider the perspectives of others, SKGians put themselves in the shoes of others, use kind and encouraging words and acts, answer the call of duties to help others in need, and put others before self. SKGians with the readiness to serve will participate actively to build the team and inspire others through leading with a heart.</p>
<p>Through managing and living with the Covid-19 pandemic in the last two years, SKGians had learnt that in the face of such a challenge, acting in socially responsible ways such as wearing masks at all times, keeping to their assigned seats, and staying at home when they are unwell with flu-like symptoms are practices of responsible decision-making. During these times, SKGians had consciously kept their learning environments like classrooms, canteens, and common areas clean. Last year, SKGians also designed special thank you cards that were presented to the estate cleaners in the Fernvale community on Labour Day and to the foreign construction workers on National Day 2021 respectively.</p>
<p>We believe that no child is too young to serve. Our teachers will augment the efforts to provide age-appropriate opportunities for students to contribute to others through the Values-In-Action Programme (See Figure 1 below), school events and many other teachable moments.</p>

<p>As we begin 2022, we need to continue to battle the Covid-19 situation. We are happy that parents now have the option of registering children aged 5 to 11 years old for Covid-19 vaccinations that enhance protection against the virus. We will need to continue to exercise personal and social responsibilities through practising the Safe Management Measures in school in 2022, so that Sengkang Green remains a safe place for the adults and students to work, learn and grow.</p>
<p>Parents are important partners of the school in our endeavour to develop each student holistically to become a wholesome individual of good character, a&nbsp;responsible citizen, and a lifelong learner. The school looks forward to working closely with parents to enable the students to achieve their learning goals.</p>

<p>Again, I wish all families a Happy New Year and a better year in 2022.</p>
<p>Mr Gau Poh Teck<br />Principal<br />Sengkang Green Primary School<br />1 January 2022</p>

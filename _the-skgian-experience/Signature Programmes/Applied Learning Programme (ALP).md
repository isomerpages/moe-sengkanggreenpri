<p><strong>&lsquo;Future Skills through Experiential Project Work (EPW)&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>At Sengkang Green Primary School, the ALP aims to internalise our school mission &lsquo;To nurture healthy and happy individual with strength of character, ready to serve, ready for the future&rsquo;. Our ALP journey commenced in 2022. It recognises the need for our students to possess skills, aptitudes and attitudes necessary to contribute in this 21<sup>st</sup> century. The programme&rsquo;s intent is to help students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the curriculum relating to the real world, and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire new knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>In this programme, we adopt a Inter-disciplinary approach, guided by Kolb&rsquo;s Experiential Learning Cycle Framework, to develop the skills, knowledge and values, in three identified competencies: Critical Thinking, Complex Problem-Solving and Cognitive Flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Kolb&rsquo;s Four Stage Learning Cycle (1984)</strong></p>

<p>The Experiential Project Work (EPW) provides varied learning experiences in which students will have the opportunity to synthesize knowledge from various areas of learning and apply it critically and creatively to real-life situations. The contextual theme in the project work is &lsquo;Sustainability and Conservation&rsquo;. Through these experiences, students will be equipped with Thinking Routines to guide them in their learning journey.</p>
<p>Our EPW in the middle primary is an ideal platform where deep learning and application of learning can take place over a period of a few weeks. Students are presented with an authentic real-life which they will need to solve. As part of their learning experiences, students will have the joy of immersing themselves in outdoor learning journeys to places of interest in Singapore, that is related to their project. This is followed by a series of lessons for students to conceptualise, applying their thinking skills, experiment and present their ideas and solutions to their peers.</p>

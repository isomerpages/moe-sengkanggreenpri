<p><u><strong>Our Strategies</strong></u></p>
<img style="width: 66%;" src="/images/cl1.jpeg">
<p>In alignment to the school&rsquo;s Teaching and Learning Framework, the department engages the students in learning through the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate the 3 primary strategies, namely Active Learning, Problem-based and Project-based learning in the MTL curriculum development;</li>
<li>Use a repertoire of school-wide student-centric pedagogies to make student learning visible through strategies such as Cooperative Learning, Collaborative Learning and Differentiated Instruction;</li>
<li>Leverage on students&rsquo; familiarity and regular use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Mother Tongue Language (MTL) learning;</li>
<li>Create platforms and opportunities that encourage students to use their MTL to communicate proficiently in everyday life and to develop a deeper appreciation of their culture; and</li>
<li>Provide timely feedback to parents on students&rsquo; learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Key Programmes<br /><br /></u></strong><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Bi-Cultural Bridge Programme<br /><br /></strong>The Bi-Cultural Bridge (BcB) programme aims to develop bicultural talents who are passionate about learning the Chinese culture and language. This programme stretches the potential of a student who is proficient in both languages and allows them to appreciate the Chinese culture in greater depth. It also provides enriched learning experiences and higher learning standards for all the high-ability learners.</p>
<p>The 2-year programme is designed to develop a core group of students from Primary 4 to Primary 5 who are effectively bilingual and bicultural. Lessons and activities are geared towards equipping students with a comprehensive understanding of Chinese culture, history, literature and the arts.</p>

<p><strong>2. SKG Celebrate cum Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</strong></p>
<p>The SKG Celebrate cum MTL Fortnight aims to create an immersive environment for our students in their learning of the Mother Tongue language and culture. During the programme, a wide range of cultural and language activities related to the Mother Tongue languages&nbsp;are&nbsp;organised for students. Activities such as&nbsp;kite making, fabric hand puppet making and dramatization&nbsp;provide opportunities for students to experience their respective cultures and also encourage them to use their Mother Tongue languages for interactions.</p>
<p>A variety of fun-filled language games and cultural activities are organised during our SKG Celebrate. We believe our young learners learn through play&nbsp;（娱教乐学）&nbsp;and imbibe&nbsp;values of respect and discipline when participating in the MTL Fortnight activities.</p>

<p><strong>4. Read@SKG</strong></p>
<p>As reading is one of the essential ways to build competency in a language, this initiative by the Mother Tongue (MT) Department runs broad-based reading programmes in the 3 Mother Tongue languages. Students are engaged in various activities after reading the selected books.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read@SKG&nbsp;aims to instil a love for reading MT storybooks in our students. The programme seeks to expose students to different genre of books suitable for their reading levels. Through reading, students will be able to build up their vocabulary of Chinese words and also build their confidence as they make improvements in their reading and comprehension skills.</p>

<p>Chinese New Year Celebration&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese New Year is an occasion for families and friends to reunite and exchange greetings. On the eve of Chinese New Year, the celebration started with class activities to allow students to understand the meaning of the celebration and the Chinese traditional customs. Everyone had a joyous time enjoying exciting hall performances.</p>

<p>Mid-Autumn Evening Celebration for Primary 1 students and parents&nbsp;</p>
<p>In creating an environment conducive for students to appreciate diverse cultures in our multiracial society, our school organises the Mid-Autumn Evening Celebration for all Primary 1 students. While the Mid-Autumn festival has its origin in the Chinese culture, it promotes the universal values of family unity. This celebration aims to provide opportunities for all P1 students to appreciate the Chinese culture and to foster bonding between parent and child. During the celebration, our P1 students and their parents go through a multi-sensory learning experience, which includes tasting of mooncakes (halal), learning how mooncakes are made, designing of lanterns, tea tasting and guessing riddles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parent-child bonding activities such as lantern-making were amongst the students&rsquo; favourite activities during Mid-autumn Evening Celebration.</p>

<p><strong><u>Department Aims and Objectives</u></strong></p>
<p>The Science department aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>stimulate child&rsquo;s curiosity and passion for science through&nbsp;<strong><u>meaningful, authentic experiences</u></strong></li>
<li>nurture&nbsp;<strong><u>reflective thinkers</u></strong>&nbsp;who ask scientific questions and appreciate how science affects their lives, the society and the environment</li>
<li>develop&nbsp;<strong><u>scientific literacy</u></strong>&nbsp;in learners to face challenges of the future&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The three integral domains in the diagram are essential in the practice of science in Sengkang Green Primary School. These domains; (a) Authentic Experiences, (b) Reflection and (c) Scientific Literacy, are interdependently connected to enable our pupils to view science as meaningful and useful.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Blended Inquiry Learning</strong></p>
<p>Blended Inquiry Learning is an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning that engages students intellectually and foster their understanding of science concepts. The key focus is to provide a customized curriculum facilitated with technology in a blended learning environment. The programme will provide a platform for our students to work collaboratively with one another through our ICAR<sup>2</sup>E Values. Students will be encouraged to be curious and explore things around them.<br /><strong><br />2. Back 2 Nature</strong></p>
<p>The Back 2 Nature programme aims to nurture the naturalistic instinct in students and curiosity about the natural world by immersing them in authentic out-of-classroom experiences. Student are encouraged to constantly question their observations and appreciate the need for continuity and survival of living organisms. Students will be given opportunities to take ownership of their learning and make meaning from these experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Key Event of the Year</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iDiscovery Day</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>iDiscovery Day aims to stimulate students&rsquo; interest in science and mathematics. The activities organise help students to conduct research and be involved in active inquiry. Students showcase projects and share their findings. In the spirit of healthy competition, pupils work together to question, observe, record and make sense of what they find. In the process, pupils collaborate, discuss and make decisions in a fun and engaging environment.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Green Awareness Campaign</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In Sengkang Green Primary School, we commemorate Earth Day. All staff and students pledge in efforts to raise public issues about environmental issues such as the 3Rs (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle), Climate Change, Conservation and the recent SGClean campaign. Students learn and share how they can play a part in conservation efforts and raise awareness with their peers and family. Participating in Earth Hour is also part of inculcating the importance of energy conservation. Through various platforms, we hope to change human behavior and better understand the urgency of spreading the message so that collectively, everyone can play a part to make the Earth safe and healthy. </p>

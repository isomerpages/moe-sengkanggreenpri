<p><strong>Aims &amp; Objectives</strong></p>
<p>To develop students into confident and competent Tamil Language users who appreciate the Tamil culture and values. Through interesting and enriching activities, we hope our students can develop<br />a love for both the language and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
<p>To provide students with a strong foundation in the 6 skills of the language, namely; Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing, Oral and Written Communication.</p>
<p><strong>Our Strategies</strong></p>

<p>In alignment to the school&rsquo;s Teaching and Learning Framework, the department engages the students in learning through the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a repertoire of school-wide student-centric pedagogies to make student learning visible through strategies such as Cooperative Learning, Collaborative Learning and Differentiated Instruction;</li>
<li>Leverage on students&rsquo; familiarity and regular use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Mother Tongue Language (MTL) learning;</li>
<li>Create platforms and opportunities that encourage students to use their MTL to communicate proficiently in everyday life and&nbsp;to develop a deeper appreciation of their culture.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><u> Reading Programme</u></li>
</ol>
<p>As reading is one of the essential ways to building competency in a language, the Tamil Language Department runs a structured reading programme for all students. Every week, one period is set aside for our Reading Programme. Students will engage in various activities after reading a book. Students can borrow a book from either the school or the class library for the reading session. This year, our students will be exposed to the following:</p>
<p>1) உள்ளூர் சிறுவர் எழுத்தாளர்கள்<br />2) எ. சகாதேவன்/<br />3) உமா பதிப்பகம்</p>

<li><u> Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</u></li>
</ol>
<p>To inculcate both awareness and appreciation of the Tamil language and culture, we have prepared an extensive range of activities for all our students including story recitation of different genres, singing of cultural and children songs, Kolam drawing, learning about traditional Indian delicacies, language games and traditional Indian games.</p>
<p>All these activities will help to give students a better understanding of both the Tamil language and culture.&nbsp;</p>

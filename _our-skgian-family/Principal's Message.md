<p><strong>Principal’s Message for 2024</strong></p><p>Dear Parents, SKGians, stakeholders and visitors to the school website,</p><p>Welcome to Sengkang Green Primary School. I wish you a happy new year.</p><p>2023 last year was a very special year for Sengkang Green Primary School when we celebrated our 10th Anniversary, reflecting on the school’s growth and development over the last decade since our founding in 2013; and charting our way ahead confidently to prepare SKGians to be ready for the future. I thank all people in the school community who had come together to make last year’s celebrations a meaningful and memorable one for everyone involved.</p><p>For 2024, the school theme is “<strong>Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Promoting Holistic Health</strong>”. The new year’s theme reminds all SKGians of our school mission “<em>to nurture healthy and happy individuals with strength of character, ready to serve, ready for the future</em>”. There are a few central ideas this theme</p><p><u>What is holistic health?</u></p><p>Promoting holistic health is an approach to health that includes the whole person. It is a comprehensive view of health that looks at multiple areas of a student’s life and examines how these areas work together to create a healthy individual. Hence, in promoting holistic health, we must that each area must work successfully together with other areas to create a healthy person.</p><p>Holistic health includes the following:</p><p><strong><em>Physical Health</em></strong> which covers food and nutrition, conscious hydration, exercise, rest and good hygiene practices.</p><p><strong><em>Mental and Emotional Health</em></strong> practices include positive self-talk, keep learning, adopting a growth mindset and increasing mindfulness. Mental health is essentially how our mind process, understand, and apply information to strengthen our ability to learn, grow, and adapt. Having good emotional health means SKGians know how to express emotions in a healthy way. It also means that SKGians are able to handle difficult emotions when they arise.</p><p><strong><em>Social Health</em></strong> is about how well we form and nurture meaningful relationships with others.</p><p><strong><em>Environmental Health</em></strong> means keeping our physical environment clean and neat, being eco-friendly and creating a supportive and healthy environment for all students and teachers.</p><p><strong><em>Spiritual Health</em></strong> refers to having a clear purpose in your role as a student. This will give you a greater sense of fulfillment and well-being.</p><p><u>Link between holistic health and future-readiness</u></p><p>Promoting holistic health helps students achieve the optimal well-being, thereby creates a more fulfilling experience in school, at home and in life.&nbsp; Students will be happy and develop a highly positive outlook in life.</p><p>Holistic health improves the cognitive ability of students, thereby empowering them to be engaged confident learners who have a high level of self-efficacy.&nbsp; Student will then strengthen their ability to learn, grow, and adapt. Students will be more ready to also learn the important 21st Century competencies.</p><p><u>SKGians are capable of take ownership of their holistic health</u></p><p>In adopting the school theme for 2024, the school aims to empower SKGians to take ownership of their health in a holistic manner.</p><p>Taking ownership of developing holistic health goes back to the fundamentals of education. It means internalising a set of sound values, strengthening habits and routines, deepening learning of social emotional competencies, thereby nurturing the strong character in each SKGian.</p><p>Primary school students are never too young to take charge of their own health. This can be achieved through lessons and activities SKGians experience in school, and through the guidance of the teachers, their parents and other significant adults.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture4.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture2.png"></div><p><u>It takes a whole village to educate the child</u></p><p>I call upon all teachers (and staff), parents, stakeholders and SKGians to rally around the school as a community to support the school theme and facilitate the process in which each SKGian can learn at his/her own pace to take charge of their health in a comprehensive manner, thereby sowing the seeds for lifelong learning and enhancing on his/her future-readiness.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture3.png"></div><p>I wish everyone a successful year ahead.</p><p>Mr Gau Poh Teck</p><p>Principal</p><p></p>

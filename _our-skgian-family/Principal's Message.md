<p><strong>Principal’s Message for 2024</strong></p><p>Dear Parents, SKGians, valued stakeholders, and visitors to our school website,</p><p>A warm welcome to Sengkang Green Primary School! As we embark on the new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes for a joyful and fulfilling 2024.</p><p>Reflecting on the journey of our school, 2023 was a truly special year as we celebrated our 10th Anniversary. It was a time to celebrate the growth and development of Sengkang Green since its founding in 2013. I would like to express my gratitude to all members of our school community who contributed to making last year's celebrations meaningful and memorable for everyone involved.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2024, our school theme is "Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Promoting Holistic Health". This theme encapsulates our commitment “<em>to nurture healthy and happy individuals with strength of character, ready to serve, ready for the future</em>”.</p><p>Let me share with you the central ideas behind our 2024 theme, "Becoming a Future-ready Learner – Promoting Holistic Health."</p><p><u>Understanding what is holistic health</u></p><p>So, what exactly is holistic health? It is an approach that considers the total well-being of your child. It looks at various aspects of health and how these areas work together to contribute to the overall well-being of your child.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture.PNG"></div><p>At Sengkang Green, our promotion of holistic health covers the following areas:</p><p><strong>Physical Health</strong>: This covers everything from food and nutrition to exercise, rest, and good hygiene practices.</p><p><strong>Mental and Emotional Health</strong>: This area involves encouraging positive self-talk, continuous learning, adopting a growth mindset, and increasing mindfulness. It is about understanding how our minds process information, handle emotions, and develop a positive and resilient mindset. It also helps SKGians find a clear purpose in their role as students, fostering a sense of fulfillment and well-being.</p><p><strong>Social Health</strong>: This area focuses on building and nurturing meaningful relationships with others. It involves good communication and getting along with one another. It is also about being part of a community and understanding our responsibility to others.</p><p><strong>Cyberwellness</strong>: Teaching our SKGians to use technology purposefully for learning, balancing offline and online activities, and being responsible digital citizens.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture4.png"></div><p><u>There is a meaningful link between holistic health and preparing our SKGians for the future</u></p><p>By promoting holistic health at an early age, children form a foundation of health literacy and awareness that increases as they grow into adulthood. Making them understand the importance of good health as early as possible will help them go on to live holistically healthy and happy lives. Imagine your child being not just happy but also developing a highly positive outlook on life – that is what holistic health can do!</p><p>Moreover, embracing holistic health enhances our SKGians' cognitive abilities. It empowers them to become engaged and confident learners with a high level of self-efficacy. This means they will be better equipped to learn, grow, and adapt – essential skills for mastering the challenges of the 21st century.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture2.png"></div><p><u>Children are never too young to take charge of their health</u></p><p>We believe that SKGians can take ownership of their holistic health. In aligning with our 2024 theme, we are committed to empowering our students to embrace their well-being in a holistic manner. Taking ownership involves internalising our ICAR2E values, developing strong habits, and deepening their understanding of social-emotional competencies, all of which contribute to nurturing a resilient character in each SKGian.</p><p>I firmly believe that primary school students are never too young to take charge of their health. Through lessons and activities in school, guided by our dedicated teachers, supportive parents, and other significant adults, our SKGians can learn such valuable skills for a lifetime of well-being.</p><p><u>Educating our young – A whole community’s effort</u></p><p>Remember, it takes a whole village to educate a child. I call upon our amazing teachers, staff, parents, stakeholders, and most importantly, our SKGians, to come together as a community. Let's support our school theme and work together to facilitate a process where each SKGian can learn at their own pace, taking charge of their health comprehensively. This, in turn, will sow the seeds for lifelong learning and enhance their future-readiness.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture3.png"></div><p>Thank you for being an integral part of our school community. I am excited about the opportunities and growth that this new year will bring for our students. Together, let us continue to support and guide our SKGians on their journey to becoming future-ready learners.</p><p></p><p>Wishing you and your families a fantastic year ahead!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gau Poh Teck</p><p>Principal Sengkang Green Primary School</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

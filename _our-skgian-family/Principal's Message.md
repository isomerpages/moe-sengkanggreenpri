<p><strong>Principal’s Message for 2023</strong></p>
<p>Dear Parents, students, stakeholders and visitors,</p>
<p>Welcome to Sengkang Green Primary School. I wish you a happy new year.</p>
<p>2023 is a very special year for the school as we celebrate the our 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary.</p>
<p>Sengkang Green Primary School has come a long way since we first started in 2013 as a new school in Sengkang West area. The school started on high grounds and is today a primary school well-received by the community, one which is impactful in the holistic development of the children in their foundation years. We are thankful to the pioneer educators of Sengkang Green led by the founding principal Mrs Daphne Yeoh for laying strong foundations for the school to grow on.</p>
<p>Sengkang Green has remained steadfast in our mission “to nurture healthy and happy individuals with strength of character, ready to serve, ready for the future”. The 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary is an important milestone for the school and the school theme “Becoming a Future-ready Learner” will take the school to greater heights in educating the young.</p>
<p>The choice of the word “becoming” signifies the steadfast practice of the ICARE values of each SKGian as he/she undertakes the continuing lifelong journey of learning that strengthens his/her character and equip him/her with the relevant dispositions, skills and knowledge to stay current and confident in an increasingly complex world.</p>
<p>In commemoration of this joyous occasion, a 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary logo has been specially designed:</p>

<p>The Music teachers have also come together to compose the 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary song “We Can Be” to capture the aspirations of SKGians. You can click on the link below to listen to this beautiful rendition of the song. SKGians will learn the song in the first week of 2023.</p>

<p>The anniversary provides the impetus for the school to chart our direction for the journey ahead and ensure the experiences that the teachers design equip SKGians for the future. The school will focus on the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empowering SKGians to take charge of their holistic health;</li>
<li>Promoting the love for bilingual reading;</li>
<li>Developing eco-stewardship to nurture SKGians to be champions of sustainability;</li>
<li>Equipping students to use technology responsibly and effectively to learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Inspired by the Tembusu tree, the school crest pictures a growing young tree which represents a growing child who is anchored in strong values, thriving in a fast-changing globalised world. The child, also represented by an open-book, is a life-long learner with a hunger for knowledge and excellence. The child is well supported by parents and teachers, forming a strong partnership in providing an all-round education, balancing the development of character and abilities.</p>
<p>The logo is presented in 2 distinct school colours of green and orange. Green represents learning and growth of our children. Orange represents vibrancy in our children who hold the key to the future of our nation.</p>
<p><strong>Tembusu Tree</strong><br>The Tembusu tree is a native plant of Singapore. It is a large, evergreen tree that grows up to 40m in height. This slow growing, long-lived hardy tree can be recognised by its deeply fissured dark brown bark and unique perpendicular branching. It is highly robust and can grow even in poorly drained, clayey soils. It is also resistant to pests and diseases. During the flowering season, its creamy white flowers open at sunset and give off a strong fragrance in the evening.</p>
<p>Similarly, we want our children to have the strength of character and thrive in the complex globalised world they live in. They will grow up to be good citizens and contribute well to society. They will remain rooted to our core values and to Singapore, our home.</p>
